description: Spanning the origins of the Earth to the outcome of the First World War,
  this is a brilliantly compelling account of the evolution of life and the development
  of the human race. Along the way, Wells considers diverse subjects, such as the
  Neolithic era, the rise of Judaism, the Golden Age of Athens, the life of Christ,
  the rise of Islam, the discovery of America and the Industrial Revolution. Breathtaking
  in its scope and passionate in its intensity, this history remains one of the most
  readable of its kind.

A SHORT HISTORY OF THE WORLD
</h2>

<h4 align="center">
THE WORLD IN SPACE
</h4>

<p>
THE story of our world is a story that is still very imperfectly
known.  A couple of hundred years ago men possessed the history of
little more than the last three thousand years.  What happened
before that time was a matter of legend and speculation.  Over a
large part of the civilized world it was believed and taught that
the world had been created suddenly in 4004 <small>B.C.</small>,
 though authorities differed as to whether this had occurred
in the spring or autumn of that year. This fantastically precise
misconception was based upon a too literal interpretation of the
Hebrew Bible, and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions
connected therewith.  Such ideas have long since been abandoned by
religious teachers, and it is universally recognized that the
universe in which we live has to all appearances existed for an
enormous period of time and possibly for endless time.  Of course
there may be deception in these appearances, as a room may be made
to seem endless by putting mirrors facing each other at either end.
But that the universe in which we live has existed only for six or
seven thousand years may be regarded as an altogether exploded idea.
</p>

<p>
The earth, as everybody knows nowadays, is a spheroid, a sphere
slightly compressed, orange fashion, with a diameter of nearly 8,000
miles.  Its spherical shape has been known at least to a limited
number of intelligent people for nearly 2,500 years, but before that
time it was supposed to be flat, and various ideas which now seem
fantastic were entertained about its relations to the sky and the
stars and planets.  We know now that it rotates upon its <span class
="pagenum">{<a name="P2"></a>2}</span>axis (which is about 24 miles
shorter than its equatorial diameter) every twenty-four hours, and
that this is the cause of the alternations of day and night, that it
circles about the sun in a slightly distorted and slowly variable
oval path in a year. Its distance from the sun varies between
ninety-one and a half millions at its nearest and ninety-four and a
half million miles.

<p>
About the earth circles a smaller sphere, the moon, at an average
 distance  of 239,000 miles. Earth and moon are not the only bodies
 to travel round  the sun.  There are also the planets, Mercury and
 Venus, at distances of  thirty-six and sixty-seven millions of
 miles; and beyond the circle of the  earth and disregarding a belt
 of numerous smaller bodies, the planetoids,  there are Mars,
 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune at mean distances of
 141, 483, 886, 1,782, and 1,793 millions of miles respectively.
  These figures in <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P3"></a>3}</span>
millions of miles are very difficult for the mind to grasp.  It may
 help the reader&rsquo;s imagination if we reduce the sun and
 planets to a smaller, more conceivable scale.

If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch
 diameter,  the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323
 yards away, that  is about a fifth of a mile, four or five
 minutes&rsquo; walking.  The  moon would be a small pea two feet
 and a half from the world.  Between earth and sun there would be
 the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus,  at distances of one
 hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and fifty  yards from the
 sun. All round and about these bodies there would be  emptiness
 until you came to Mars, a hundred and seventy-five feet beyond the
 earth; Jupiter <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P4"></a>4}</span>
nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter; Saturn, a little smaller,
 two miles off; Uranus four miles off and Neptune six miles off.
  Then nothingness and nothingness except for small particles and
 drifting scraps of attenuated vapour for thousands of miles.  The
 nearest star to earth on this scale would be 40,000 miles away.
</p>

<p>
These figures will serve perhaps to give one some conception of the
 immense emptiness of space in which the drama of life goes on.
</p>

<p>
For in all this enormous vacancy of space we know certainly of life
 only  upon the surface of our earth. It does not penetrate much
 more than three miles down into the 4,000 miles that separate us
 from the centre of our globe, and it does not reach more than five
 miles above its surface.  Apparently all the limitlessness of space
 is otherwise empty and dead.
</p>

<p>
The deepest ocean dredgings go down to five miles. The highest
 recorded flight of an aeroplane is little more than four miles.
  Men have reached to seven miles up in balloons, but at a cost of
 great suffering.  No bird can fly so high as five miles, and small
 birds and insects which have been carried up by aeroplanes drop off
 insensible far below that level.

<h4 align="center">THE WORLD IN TIME</h4>

<p>
IN the last fifty years there has been much very fine and
 interesting speculation on the part of scientific men upon the age
 and origin of our earth.  Here we cannot pretend to give even a
 summary of such speculations because they involve the most subtle
 mathematical and physical considerations.  The truth is that the
 physical and astronomical sciences are still too undeveloped as yet
 to make anything of the sort more than an illustrative guesswork.
  The general tendency has been to make the estimated age of our
 globe longer and longer.  It now seems probable that the earth has
 had an independent existence as a spinning planet flying round and
 round the sun for a longer period than 2,000,000,000 years.  It may
 have been much longer than that. This is a length of time that
 absolutely overpowers the imagination.
</p>

<p>
Before that vast period of separate existence, the sun and earth and
the other planets that circulate round the sun may have been a great
swirl of diffused matter in space.  The telescope reveals to us in
various parts of the heavens luminous spiral clouds of matter, the
spiral nebul&#230;, which appear to be in rotation about a centre.
  It is supposed by many astronomers that the sun and its planets
 were once such a spiral, and that their matter has undergone
 concentration into its present form. Through majestic &#230;ons
 that concentration went on until in that vast remoteness of the
 past for which we have given figures, the world and its moon were
 distinguishable.  They were spinning then much faster than they are
 spinning now; they were at a lesser distance from the sun; they
 travelled round it very much faster, and they were probably
 incandescent or molten at the surface.  The sun itself was a much
 greater blaze in the heavens.

<p>
If we could go back through that infinitude of time and see the
 earth in this earlier stage of its history, we should behold a
 scene more like the interior of a blast furnace or the surface of a
 lava flow before it cools and cakes over than any other
 contemporary scene.  No water would be visible because all the
 water there was would still be superheated steam in a stormy
 atmosphere of sulphurous and metallic vapours.  Beneath this
 would swirl and boil an ocean of molten rock substance.  Across a
 sky of fiery clouds the glare of the hurrying sun
and moon would sweep swiftly like hot breaths of flame.

<p>
Slowly by degrees as one million of years followed another,
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P8"></a>8}</span> this fiery scene
would lose its eruptive incandescence.  The vapours in the sky would
rain down and become less dense overhead; great slaggy cakes of
solidifying rock would appear upon the surface of the molten sea,
and sink under it, to be replaced by other floating masses.  The
sun and moon growing now each more distant and each smaller, would
rush with diminishing swiftness across the heavens. The moon now,
because of its smaller size, would be already cooled far below
incandescence, and would be alternately obstructing and reflecting
the sunlight in a series of eclipses and full moons.

And so with a tremendous slowness through the vastness of time, the
earth would grow more and more like the earth on which we live, until
at last an age would come when, in the cooling air, steam would begin
to condense into clouds, and the first rain would fall hissing upon
the first rocks below.  For endless millenia the greater part of the
earth&rsquo;s water would still be vaporized in the atmosphere, but
there would now be hot streams running over the crystallizing
rocks below and pools and lakes into which these streams would be
carrying detritus and depositing sediment.

&ldquo;Great lava-like masses of rock without traces of soil&rdquo;
</h5></center>

<p>
At last a condition of things must have been attained in which a
man might have stood up on earth and looked about him and lived.
If we could have visited the earth at that time we should have
stood on great lava-like masses of rock without a trace of soil
or touch of living vegetation, under a storm-rent sky.  Hot and
violent winds, exceeding the fiercest tornado that ever blows,
and downpours of rain such as our milder, slower earth to-day
knows nothing of, might have assailed us.  The water of the
downpour would have rushed by us, muddy with the spoils of the
rocks, coming together into torrents, cutting deep gorges and
canyons as they hurried past to deposit their sediment in the
earliest seas.  Through the clouds we should have glimpsed a great
sun moving visibly across the sky, and in its wake and in the wake
of the moon would have come a diurnal tide of earthquake and
upheaval. And

<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P10"></a>10}</span>

the moon, which nowadays keeps one constant face to earth, would
then have been rotating visibly and showing the side it now hides
so inexorably.
</p>

<p>
The earth aged.  One million years followed another, and the day
lengthened, the sun grew more distant and milder, the moon&rsquo;s
pace in the sky slackened; the intensity of rain and storm
diminished and the water in the first seas increased and ran
together into the ocean garment our planet henceforth wore.
</p>

<p>
But there was no life as yet upon the earth; the seas were lifeless,
and the rocks were barren.

<h4 align="center">THE BEGINNINGS OF LIFE</h4>

<p>
AS everybody knows nowadays, the knowledge we possess of life before
the beginnings of human memory and tradition is derived from the
markings and fossils of living things in the stratified rocks. We
find preserved in shale and slate, limestone, and sandstone, bones,
shells, fibres, stems, fruits, footmarks, scratchings and the like,
side by side with the ripple marks of the earliest tides and the
pittings of the earliest rain-falls. It is by the sedulous
examination of this Record of the Rocks that the past history of the
earth&rsquo;s life has been pieced together.  That much nearly
everybody knows to-day.  The sedimentary rocks do not lie neatly
stratum above stratum; they have been crumpled, bent, thrust about,
distorted and mixed together like the leaves of a library that has
been repeatedly looted and burnt, and it is only as a result of many
devoted lifetimes of work that the record has been put into order
and read.  The whole compass of time represented by the record of
the rocks is now estimated as 1,600,000,000 years.
</p>

<p>
The earliest rocks in the record are called by geologists the Azoic
 rocks, because they show no traces of life.  Great areas of these
 Azoic rocks lie uncovered in North America, and they are of such a
 thickness that geologists consider that they represent a period of
 at least half of the 1,600,000,000 which they assign to the whole
 geological record.  Let me repeat this profoundly significant fact.
  Half the great interval of time since land and sea were first
 distinguishable on earth has left us no traces of life.  There are
 ripplings and rain marks still to be found in these rocks, but no
 marks nor vestiges of any living thing.

Then, as we come up the record, signs of past life appear and
 increase.  The age of the world&rsquo;s history in which we find
 these past

<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P13"></a>13}</span>

traces is called by geologists the Lower Pal&#230;ozoic age.
  The first indications that life was astir are vestiges of
 comparatively simple and lowly things: the shells of small
 shellfish, the stems and flowerlike heads of zoophytes, seaweeds
 and the tracks and remains of sea worms and crustacea.  Very early
 appear certain creatures rather like plant-lice, crawling creatures
 which could roll themselves up into balls as the plant-lice do, the
 trilobites.  Later by a few million years or so come certain sea
 scorpions, more mobile and powerful creatures than the world had
 ever seen before.

<p>
None of these creatures were of very great size.  Among the largest
 were certain of the sea scorpions, which measured nine feet in
 length.  There are no signs whatever of land life of any sort,
 plant or animal; there are no fishes nor any vertebrated creatures
 in this part of the record.  Essentially all the plants and
 creatures which have left us their traces from this period of the
 earth&rsquo;s history are shallow-water and intertidal beings.  If
 we wished to parallel the flora and fauna of the Lower
 Pal&#230;ozoic rocks on the earth to-day, we should do it best,
 except in the matter of size, by taking a drop of water from a rock
 pool or scummy ditch and examining it under a microscope.  The
 little crustacea, the small shellfish, the zoophytes and alg&#230;
 we should find there would display a quite striking resemblance to
 these clumsier, larger prototypes that once were the crown of life
 upon our planet.

<p>
It is well, however, to bear in mind that the Lower Pal&#230;ozoic
 rocks probably do not give us anything at all representative of the
 first beginnings of life on our planet. Unless a creature has bones
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P14"></a>14}</span>or other hard
 parts, unless it wears a shell or is big enough and heavy enough to
 make characteristic footprints and trails in mud, it is unlikely to
 leave any fossilized traces of its existence behind.  To-day there
 are hundreds of thousands of species of small soft-bodied creatures
 in our world which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark for
 future geologists to discover.  In the world&rsquo;s past, millions
 of millions of species of such creatures may have lived and
 multiplied and flourished and passed away without a trace
 remaining.  The waters of the warm and shallow lakes and seas of
 the so-called Azoic period may have teemed with an infinite variety
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P15"></a>15}</span>of lowly,
 jelly-like, shell-less and boneless creatures, and a multitude of
 green scummy plants may have spread over the sunlit intertidal
 rocks and beaches.  The Record of the Rocks is no more a complete
 record of life in the past than the books of a bank are a record of
 the existence of everybody in the neighbourhood.  It is only when a
 species begins to secrete a shell or a spicule or a carapace or a
 lime-supported stem, and so put by something for the future, that
 it goes upon the Record.  But in rocks of an age prior to those
 which bear any fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined
 carbon, is sometimes found, and some authorities consider that it
 may have been separated out from combination through the vital
 activities of unknown living things.

<h4 align="center">THE AGE OF FISHES</h4>

<p>
IN the days when the world was supposed to have endured for only a
 few thousand years, it was supposed that the different species of
 plants and animals were fixed and final; they had all been created
 exactly as they are to-day, each species by itself.  But as men
 began to discover and study the Record of the Rocks this belief
 gave place to the suspicion that many species had changed and
 developed slowly through the course of ages, and this again
 expanded into a belief in what is called Organic Evolution, a
 belief that all species of life upon earth, animal and vegetable
 alike, are descended by slow continuous processes of change from
 some very simple ancestral form of life, some almost structureless
 living substance, far back in the so-called Azoic seas.
</p>

<p>
This question of Organic Evolution, like the question of the age of
 the earth, has in the past been the subject of much bitter
 controversy.  There was a time when a belief in organic evolution
 was for rather obscure reasons supposed to be incompatible with
 sound Christian, Jewish and Moslem doctrine.  That time has passed,
 and the men of the most orthodox Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and
 Mohammedan belief are now free to accept this newer and broader
 view of a common origin of all living things.  No life seems to
 have happened suddenly upon earth.  Life grew and grows.  Age by
 age through gulfs of time at which imagination reels, life has been
 growing from a mere stirring in the intertidal slime towards
 freedom, power and consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Life consists of individuals. These individuals are definite things,
 they are not like the lumps and masses, nor even the limitless and
 motionless crystals, of non-living matter, and they have two
 characteristics no dead matter possesses.  They can assimilate
 other matter into themselves and make it part of themselves, and
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P17"></a>17}</span>they can
 reproduce themselves.  They eat and they breed.  They can give rise
 to other individuals, for the most part like themselves, but always
 also a little different from themselves.  There is a specific and
 family resemblance between an individual and its offspring, and
 there is an individual difference between every parent and every
 offspring it produces, and this is true in every species and at
 every stage of life.

 SHOWING BODY ARMOUR
</h4>
</center>

<p>
Now scientific men are not able to explain to us either why
 offspring should resemble nor why they should differ from their
 parents.  But seeing that offspring do at once resemble and differ,
 it is a matter rather of common sense than of scientific knowledge
 that, if the conditions under which a species live are changed, the
 species should undergo some correlated changes.  Because in any
 generation of the species there must be a number of individuals
 whose individual differences make them better adapted to the new
 conditions under which the species has to live, and a number whose
 individuals whose individual differences make it rather harder for
 them to live.  And on the whole the former sort will live longer,
 bear more offspring, and reproduce themselves more abundantly than
 the latter, and so generation by generation the average of the
 species will change in the favourable direction.  This process,
 which is called Natural Selection, is not so much a scientific
 theory as a necessary deduction
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P18"></a>18}</span>from the facts
 of reproduction and individual difference.  There may be many
 forces at work varying, destroying and preserving species, about
 which science may still be unaware or undecided, but the man who
 can deny the operation of this process of natural selection upon
 life since its beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary
 facts of life or incapable of ordinary thought.
</p>

<p>
Many scientific men have speculated about the first beginning of
 life and their speculations are often of great interest, but there
 is absolutely no definite knowledge and no convincing guess yet of
 the way in which life began.  But nearly all authorities are agreed
 that it probably began upon mud or sand in warm sunlit shallow
 brackish water, and that it spread up the beaches to the intertidal
 lines and out to the open waters.

<p>
That early world was a world of strong tides and currents.  An
 incessant destruction of individuals must have been going on
 through their being swept up the beaches and dried, or by their
 being swept out to sea and sinking down out of reach of air and
 sun.  Early conditions favoured the development of every tendency
 to root and hold on, every tendency to form an outer skin and
 casing to protect the stranded individual from immediate
 desiccation.  From the very earliest any tendency to sensitiveness
 to taste would turn the individual in the direction of food, and
 any sensitiveness to light would assist it to struggle back out of
 the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to wriggle back out of
 the excessive glare of the dangerous shallows.
</p>

<p>
Probably the first shells and body armour of living things were
 protections against drying rather than against active enemies.
  But tooth and claw come early into our earthly history.
</p>

<p>
We have already noted the size of the earlier water scorpions.  For
 long ages such creatures were the supreme lords of life. Then <span
 class="pagenum">{<a name="P19"></a>19}</span>in a division of these
 Pal&#230;ozoic rocks called the Silurian division, which many
 geologists now suppose to be as old as five hundred million years,
 there appears a new type of being, equipped with eyes and teeth and
 swimming powers of an altogether more powerful kind.  These were
 the first known backboned animals, the earliest fishes, the first
 known Vertebrata.

<p>
These fishes increase greatly in the next division of rocks, the
 rocks known as the Devonian system.  They are so prevalent that
 this period of the Record of the Rocks has been called the Age of
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P20"></a>20}</span>Fishes.  Fishes
 of a pattern now gone from the earth, and fishes allied to the
 sharks and sturgeons of to-day, rushed through the waters, leapt in
 the air, browsed among the seaweeds, pursued and preyed upon one
 another, and gave a new liveliness to the waters of the world.
  None of these were excessively big by our present standards.  Few
 of them were more than two or three feet long, but there were
 exceptional forms which were as long as twenty feet.
</p>

<p>
We know nothing from geology of the ancestors of these fishes.  They
 do not appear to be related to any of the forms that preceded them.
  Zoologists have the most interesting views of their ancestry, but
 these they derive from the study of the development of the eggs of
 their still living relations, and from other sources.  Apparently
 the ancestors of the vertebrata were soft-bodied and perhaps quite
 small swimming creatures who began first to develop hard parts as
 teeth round and about their mouths.  The teeth of a skate or
 dogfish cover the roof and floor of its mouth and pass at the lip
 into the flattened toothlike scales that encase most of its body.
  As the fishes develop these teeth scales in the geological record,
 they swim out of the hidden darkness of the past into the light,
 the first vertebrated animals visible in the record.

<h4 align="center">THE AGE OF THE COAL SWAMPS</h4>

<p>
THE land during this Age of Fishes was apparently quite lifeless.
  Crags and uplands of barren rock lay under the sun and rain.
  There was no real soil&#8212;for as yet there were no earthworms
 which help to make a soil, and no plants to break up the rock
 particles into mould; there was no trace of moss or lichen.
  Life was still only in the sea.
</p>

<p>
Over this world of barren rock played great changes of climate.
  The causes of these changes of climate were very complex and they
 have still to be properly estimated.  The changing shape of the
 earth&rsquo;s orbit, the gradual shifting of the poles of rotation,
 changes in the shapes of the continents, probably even fluctuations
 in the warmth of the sun, now conspired to plunge great areas of
 the earth&rsquo;s surface into long periods of cold and ice and now
 again for millions of years spread a warm or equable climate over
 this planet.  There seem to have been phases of great internal
 activity in the world&rsquo;s history, when in the course of a few
 million years accumulated upthrusts would break out in lines of
 volcanic eruption and upheaval and rearrange the mountain and
 continental outlines of the globe, increasing the depth of the sea
 and the height of the mountains and exaggerating the extremes of
 climate.  And these would be followed by vast ages of comparative
 quiescence, when frost, rain and river would wear down the mountain
 heights and carry great masses of silt to fill and raise the sea
 bottoms and spread the seas, ever shallower and wider, over more
 and more of the land.  There have been &ldquo;high and deep&rdquo;
 ages in the world&rsquo;s history and &ldquo;low and level&rdquo;
 ages.  The reader must dismiss from his mind any idea that the
 surface of the earth has been growing steadily cooler since its
 crust grew solid.  After that much cooling had been achieved, the
 internal temperature ceased to affect surface
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P22"></a>22}</span>conditions.
 There are traces of periods of superabundant ice and snow, of
 &ldquo;Glacial Ages,&rdquo; that is, even in the Azoic period.
</p>

<p>
It was only towards the close of the Age of Fishes, in a period of
 extensive shallow seas and lagoons, that life spread itself out in
 any effectual way from the waters on to the land.  No doubt the
 earlier types of the forms that now begin to appear in great
 abundance had already been developing in a rare and obscure manner
 for many scores of millions of years.  But now came their
 opportunity.

Plants no doubt preceded animal forms in this invasion of the land,
 but the animals probably followed up the plant emigration
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P23"></a>23}</span>very closely.
  The first problem that the plant had to solve was the problem of
 some sustaining stiff support to hold up its fronds to the sunlight
 when the buoyant water was withdrawn; the second was the problem of
 getting water from the swampy ground below to the tissues of the
 plant, now that it was no longer close at hand.  The two problems
 were solved by the development of woody tissue which both sustained
 the plant and acted as water carrier to the leaves.  The Record of
 the Rocks is suddenly crowded by a vast variety of woody swamp
 plants, many of them of great size, big tree mosses, tree ferns,
 gigantic horsetails and the like.  And with these, age by age,
 there crawled out of the water a great variety of animal forms.
  There were centipedes and millipedes; there were the first
 primitive insects; there were creatures related to the ancient king
 crabs and sea scorpions which became the earliest spiders and land
 scorpions, and presently there were vertebrated animals.

Some of the earlier insects were very large. There were dragon flies
 in this period with wings that spread out to twenty-nine inches.
</p>

<p>
In various ways these new orders and genera had adapted themselves
 to breathing air.  Hitherto all animals had breathed air dissolved
 in water, and that indeed is what all animals still have to do.
  But now in divers fashions the animal kingdom was acquiring the
 power of supplying its own moisture where it was needed.  A man
 with a perfectly dry lung would suffocate to-day;
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P24"></a>24}</span>his lung
 surfaces must be moist in order that air may pass through them
 into his blood.  The adaptation to air breathing consists in all
 cases either in the development of a cover to the old-fashioned
 gills to stop evaporation, or in the development of tubes or other
 new breathing organs lying deep inside the body and moistened by a
 watery secretion.  The old gills with which the ancestral fish of
 the vertebrated line had breathed were inadaptable to breathing
 upon land, and in the case of this division of the animal kingdom
 it is the swimming bladder of the fish which becomes a new,
 deep-seated breathing organ, the lung.  The kind of animals known
 as amphibia, the frogs and newts of to-day, begin their lives in
 the water and breathe by gills; and subsequently the lung,
 developing in the same way as the swimming bladder of many fishes
 do, as a baglike outgrowth from the throat, takes over the business
 of breathing, the animal comes out on land, and the gills dwindle
 and the gill slits disappear.  (All except an outgrowth of one gill
 slit, which becomes the passage of the ear and ear-drum.)  The
 animal can now live only in the air, but it must return at least to
 the edge of the water to lay its eggs and reproduce its kind.

<p>
All the air-breathing vertebrata of this age of swamps and plants
 belonged to the class amphibia.  They were nearly all of them forms
 related to the newts of to-day, and some of them attained a
 considerable size.  They were land animals, it is true, but they
 were land animals needing to live in and near moist and swampy
 places, and all the great trees of this period were equally
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P25"></a>25}</span>amphibious in
 their habits.  None of them had yet developed fruits and seeds of a
 kind that could fall on land and develop with the help only of such
 moisture as dew and rain could bring.  They all had to shed their
 spores in water, it would seem, if they were to germinate.
</p>

<p>
It is one of the most beautiful interests of that beautiful science,
 comparative anatomy, to trace the complex and wonderful adaptations
 of living things to the necessities of existence in air.  All
 living things, plants and animals alike, are primarily water
 things.  For example all the higher vertebrated animals above the
 fishes, up to and including man, pass through a stage in their
 development in the egg or before birth in which they have gill
 slits which are obliterated before the young emerge.  The bare,
 water-washed eye of the fish is protected in the higher forms from
 drying up by eyelids and glands which secrete moisture.  The weaker
 sound vibrations of air necessitate an ear-drum.  In nearly every
 organ of the body similar modifications and adaptations are to be
 detected, similar patchings-up to meet aerial conditions.
</p>

<p>
This Carboniferous age, this age of the amphibia, was an age of life
 in the swamps and lagoons and on the low banks among these waters.
  Thus far life had now extended.  The hills and high lands were
 still quite barren and lifeless.  Life had learnt to breathe air
 indeed, but it still had its roots in its native water; it still
 had to return to the water to reproduce its kind.

<h4 align="center">THE AGE OF REPTILES</h4>

<p>
THE abundant life of the Carboniferous period was succeeded by a
vast cycle of dry and bitter ages.  They are represented in the
Record of the Rocks by thick deposits of sandstones and the like, in
which fossils are comparatively few.  The temperature of the world
fluctuated widely, and there were long periods of glacial cold.
  Over great areas the former profusion of swamp vegetation ceased,
and, overlaid by these newer deposits, it began that process of
compression and mineralization that gave the world most of the coal
deposits of to-day.
</p>

<p>
But it is during periods of change that life undergoes its most
rapid modifications, and under hardship that it learns its hardest
lessons.  As conditions revert towards warmth and moisture again we
find a new series of animal and plant forms established,  We find in
the record the remains of vertebrated animals that laid eggs which,
instead of hatching out tadpoles which needed to live for a time in
water, carried on their development before hatching to a stage so
nearly like the adult form that the young could live in air from the
first moment of independent existence.  Gills had been cut out
altogether, and the gill slits only appeared as an embryonic phase.
</p>

<p>
These new creatures without a tadpole stage were the Reptiles.
  Concurrently there had been a development of seed-bearing trees,
which could spread their seed, independently of swamp or lakes.
  There were now palmlike cycads and many tropical conifers, though as
yet there were no flowering plants and no grasses.  There was a
great number of ferns.  And there was now also an increased variety
of insects.  There were beetles, though bees and butterflies had yet
to come.  But all the fundamental forms of a new real land fauna and
flora had been laid down during these vast ages of severity.  <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P27"></a>27}</span>This new land life
needed only the opportunity of favourable conditions to flourish and

Age by age and with abundant fluctuations that mitigation came.  The
still incalculable movements of the earth&rsquo;s crust, the changes
in its orbit, the increase and diminution of the mutual inclination
of orbit and pole, worked together to produce a great spell of
widely diffused warm conditions.  The period lasted altogether, it
is now supposed, upwards of two hundred million years.  It is called
the Mesozoic period, to distinguish it from the altogether vaster
Pal&#230;ozoic and Azoic periods (together fourteen hundred
millions) that preceded it, and from the Cainozoic or new life
period that intervened between its close and the present time, and
it is also called the Age of Reptiles because of the astonishing
predominance and variety of this form of life.  It came to an end
some eighty million  years ago.
</p>

<p>
In the world to-day the genera of Reptiles are comparatively few and
their distribution is very limited.  They are more various, it is
true, than are the few surviving members of the order of the
amphibia which once in the Carboniferous period ruled the world.  We
still have the snakes, the turtles and tortoises (the Chelonia),
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P28"></a>28}</span>the alligators
and crocodiles, and the lizards.  Without exception they are
creatures requiring warmth all the year round; they cannot stand
exposure to cold, and it is probable that all the reptilian beings
of the Mesozoic suffered under the same limitation.  It was a
hothouse fauna, living amidst a hothouse flora.  It endured no
frosts.  But the world had at least attained a real dry land fauna
and flora as distinguished from the mud and swamp fauna and flora of
the previous heyday of life upon earth.

All the sorts of reptile we know now were much more abundantly
represented then, great turtles and tortoises, big crocodiles and
many lizards and snakes, but in addition there was a number of
series of wonderful creatures that have now vanished altogether from
the earth.  There was a vast variety of beings called the Dinosaurs.
  Vegetation was now spreading over the lower levels of the world,
reeds, brakes of fern and the like; and browsing upon this abundance
came a multitude of herbivorous reptiles, which increased in size as
the Mesozoic period rose to its climax.  Some of these beasts
exceeded in size any other land animals that have ever lived; they
were as large as whales.  The <i>Diplodocus Carnegii</i> for example
measured eighty-four feet from snout to tail; the Gigantosaurus was
even greater; it measured a hundred feet.  Living upon these
monsters was a swarm of carnivorous Dinosaurs of a corresponding
size.  One of these, the Tyrannosaurus, is figured and described in
many books as the last word in reptilian frightfulness.

<p>
While these great creatures pastured and pursued amidst the fronds
and evergreens of the Mesozoic jungles, another now vanished tribe
of reptiles, with a bat-like development of the fore limbs, pursued
insects and one another, first leapt and parachuted and presently
flew amidst the fronds and branches of the forest trees.  These were
the Pterodactyls. These were the first flying creatures with
backbones; they mark a new achievement in the growing powers of
vertebrated life.
</p>

<p>
Moreover some of the reptiles were returning to the sea waters.
  Three groups of big swimming beings had invaded the sea from which
their ancestors had come: the Mososaurs, the Plesiosaurs, and
Ichthyosaurs.  Some of these again approached the proportions of our
present whales.  The Ichthyosaurs seem to have been quite seagoing
creatures, but the Plesiosaurs were a type of animal that has no
cognate form to-day.  The body was stout and big with paddles,
adapted either for swimming or crawling through marshes, or along
the bottom of shallow waters.  The comparatively small <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P30"></a>30}</span>head was poised on a
vast snake of neck, altogether outdoing the neck of the swan.
  Either the Plesiosaur swam and searched for food under the water and
fed as the swan will do, or it lurked under water and snatched at
passing fish or beast.
</p>

<p>
Such was the predominant land life throughout the Mesozoic age.  It
was by our human standards an advance upon anything that had
preceded it.  It had produced land animals greater in size, range,
power and activity, more &ldquo;vital&rdquo; as people say, than
anything the world had seen before.  In the seas there had been no
such advance but a great proliferation of new forms of life.  An
enormous variety of squid-like creatures with chambered shells, for
the most part coiled, had appeared in the shallow seas, the
Ammonites.  They had had predecessors in the Pal&#230;ozoic seas,
but now was their age of glory.  To-day they have left no survivors
at all; their nearest relation is the pearly Nautilus, an inhabitant
of tropical waters.  And a new and more prolific type of fish with
lighter, finer scales than the plate-like and tooth-like coverings
that had hitherto prevailed, became and has since remained
predominant in the seas and rivers.

<h4 align="center">THE FIRST BIRDS AND THE FIRST MAMMALS</h4>

<p>
IN a few paragraphs a picture of the lush vegetation and swarming
reptiles of that first great summer of life, the Mesozoic period,
has been sketched.  But while the Dinosaurs lorded it over the hot
selvas and marshy plains and the Pterodactyls filled the forests
with their flutterings and possibly with shrieks and croakings as
they pursued the humming insect life of the still flowerless shrubs
and trees, some less conspicuous and less abundant forms upon the
margins of this abounding life were acquiring certain powers and
learning certain lessons of endurance, that were to be of the utmost
value to their race when at last the smiling generosity of sun and
earth began to fade.
</p>

<p>
A group of tribes and genera of hopping reptiles, small creatures of
 the dinosaur type, seem to have been pushed by competition and the
 pursuit of their enemies towards the alternatives of extinction or
 adaptation to colder conditions in the higher hills or by the sea.
    Among these distressed tribes there was developed a new type of
 scale&#8212;scales that were elongated into quill-like forms and
 that presently branched into the crude beginnings of feathers.
    These quill-like scales layover one another and formed a
 heat-retaining covering more efficient than any reptilian covering
 that had hitherto existed.  So they permitted an invasion of colder
 regions that were otherwise uninhabited.  Perhaps simultaneously
 with these changes there arose in these creatures a greater
 solicitude for their eggs.  Most reptiles are apparently quite
 careless about their eggs, which are left for sun and season to
 hatch.  But some of the varieties upon this new branch of the tree
 of life were acquiring a habit of guarding their eggs and keeping
 them warm with the warmth of their bodies.
</p>

<p>
With these adaptations to cold other internal modifications <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P32"></a>32}</span>were going on that made
these creatures, the primitive birds, warm-blooded and independent
of basking.  The very earliest birds seem to have been seabirds
living upon fish, and their fore limbs were not wings but paddles
rather after the penguin type.  That peculiarly primitive bird, the
New Zealand Ki-Wi, has feathers of a very simple sort, and neither
flies nor appears to be descended from flying ancestors.  In the
development of the birds, feathers came before wings.  But once the
feather was developed the possibility of making a light spread of
feathers led inevitably to the wing.  We know of the fossil remains
of one bird at least which had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long
reptilian tail, but which also had a true bird&rsquo;s wing and
which certainly flew and held its own among the pterodactyls of the
Mesozoic time.  Nevertheless birds were neither varied nor abundant
in Mesozoic times.  If a man could go back to typical Mesozoic
country, he might walk for days and never see or hear such a thing
as a bird, though he would see a great abundance of pterodactyls and
insects among the fronds and reeds.

And another thing he would probably never see, and that would be any
sign of a mammal.  Probably the first mammals were in <span

<p>
The earliest mammals, like the earliest birds, were creatures driven
by competition and pursuit into a life of hardship and adaptation to
cold.  With them also the scale became quill-like, and was developed
into a heat-retaining covering; and they too underwent
modifications, similar in kind though different in detail, to become
warm-blooded and independent of basking.  Instead of feathers they
developed hairs, and instead of guarding and incubating their eggs
they kept them warm and safe by retaining them inside their bodies
until they were almost mature.  Most of them became altogether
vivaparous and brought their young into the world alive.  And even
after their young were born they tended to maintain a protective and
nutritive association with them.  Most <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P34"></a>34}</span>but not all mammals to-day have mamm&#230;
and suckle their young.  Two mammals still live which lay eggs and
which have not proper mamm&#230;, though they nourish their young by
a nutritive secretion of the under skin; these are the duck-billed
platypus and the echidna.  The echidna lays leathery eggs and then
puts them into a pouch under its belly, and so carries them about
warm and safe until they hatch.
</p>

<p>
But just as a visitor to the Mesozoic world might have searched for
days and weeks before finding a bird, so, unless he knew exactly
where to go and look, he might have searched in vain for any traces
of a mammal.  Both birds and mammals would have seemed very
eccentric and secondary and unimportant creatures in Mesozoic times.

The Age of Reptiles lasted, it is now guessed, eighty million years.
  Had any quasi-human intelligence been watching the world through
that inconceivable length of time, how safe and eternal the sunshine
and abundance must have seemed, how assured the wallowing prosperity
of the dinosaurs and the flapping abundance of the flying lizards!
And then the mysterious rhythms and accumulating forces of the
universe began to turn against that quasi-eternal stability.  That
run of luck <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P36"></a>36}</span>for
 life was running out.  Age by age, myriad of years after myriad of
 years, with halts no doubt and retrogressions, came a change
 towards hardship and extreme conditions, came great alterations of
 level and great redistributions of mountain and sea.  We find one
 thing in the Record of the Rocks during the decadence of the long
 Mesozoic age of prosperity that is very significant of steadily
 sustained changes of condition, and that is a violent fluctuation
 of living forms and the appearance of new and strange species.
  Under the gathering threat of extinction the older orders and
 genera are displaying their utmost capacity for variation and
 adaptation.  The Ammonites for example in these last pages of the
 Mesozoic chapter exhibit a multitude of fantastic forms.  Under
 settled conditions there is no encouragement for novelties; they do
 not develop, they are suppressed; what is best adapted is already
 there.  Under novel conditions it is the ordinary type that
 suffers, and the novelty that may have a better chance to survive
 and establish itself....
</p>

<p>
There comes a break in the Record of the Rocks that may represent
several million years.  There is a veil here still, over even the
outline of the history of life.  When it lifts again, the Age of
Reptiles is at an end; the Dinosaurs, the Plesiosaurs and
Ichthyosaurs, the Pterodactyls, the innumerable genera and species
of Ammonite have all gone absolutely.  In all their stupendous
variety they have died out and left no descendants.  The cold has
killed them.  All their final variations were insufficient; they had
never hit upon survival conditions.  The world had passed through a
phase of extreme conditions beyond their powers of endurance, a slow
and complete massacre of Mesozoic life has occurred, and we find now
a new scene, a new and hardier flora, and a new and hardier fauna in
possession of the world.
</p>

<p>
It is still a bleak and impoverished scene with which this new
volume of the book of life begins. The cycads and tropical conifers
have given place very largely to trees that shed their leaves to
avoid destruction by the snows of winter and to flowering plants and
shrubs, and where there was formerly a profusion of reptiles, an
increasing variety of birds and mammals is entering into their
inheritance.

<h4 align="center">THE AGE OF MAMMALS</h4>

<p>
THE opening of the next great period in the life of the earth, the
Cainozoic period, was a period of upheaval and extreme volcanic
activity.  Now it was that the vast masses of the Alps and Himalayas
and the mountain backbone of the Rockies and Andes were thrust up,
and that the rude outlines of our present oceans and continents
appeared.  The map of the world begins to display a first dim
resemblance to the map of to-day.  It is estimated now that between
forty and eighty million years have elapsed from the beginnings of
the Cainozoic period to the present time.
</p>

<p>
At the outset of the Cainozoic period the climate of the
world was austere.  It grew generally warmer until a fresh
phase of great abundance was reached, after which conditions
grew hard again and the earth passed into a series of
extremely cold cycles, the Glacial Ages, from which
apparently it is now slowly emerging.
</p>

<p>
But we do not know sufficient of the causes of climatic
change at present to forecast the possible fluctuations of
climatic conditions that lie before us.  We may be moving
towards increasing sunshine or lapsing towards another
glacial age; volcanic activity and the upheaval of mountain
masses may be increasing or diminishing; we do not know; we
lack sufficient science.
</p>

<p>
With the opening of this period the grasses appear; for the
first time there is pasture in the world; and with the full
development of the once obscure mammalian type, appear a
number of interesting grazing animals and of carnivorous
types which prey upon these.
</p>

<p>
At first these early mammals seem to differ only in a few
characters from the great herbivorous and carnivorous
reptiles that ages before had flourished and then vanished
from the earth.  A <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P38"></a>38}</span>careless observer might suppose that
in this second long age of warmth and plenty that was now
beginning, nature was merely repeating the first, with
herbivorous and carnivorous mammals to parallel the
herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, with birds replacing
pterodactyls and so on.  But this would be an altogether
superficial comparison.  The variety of the universe is
infinite and incessant; it progresses eternally; history
never repeats itself and no parallels are precisely true.
  The differences between the life of the Cainozoic and
Mesozoic periods are far profounder than the resemblances.

<p>
The most fundamental of all these differences lies in the
mental life of the two periods.  It arises essentially out of
the continuing contact of parent and offspring which
distinguishes mammalian and in a lesser degree bird life,
from the life of the reptile.  With very few exceptions the
reptile abandons its egg to hatch alone.  The young reptile
has no knowledge whatever of its parent; its mental life,
such as it is, begins and ends with its own experiences.
  <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P39"></a>39}</span>It may
tolerate the existence of its fellows but it has no
communication with them; it never imitates, never learns from
them, is incapable of concerted action with them.  Its life
is that of an isolated individual.  But with the suckling and
cherishing of young which was distinctive of the new
mammalian and avian strains arose the possibility of learning
by imitation, of communication, by warning cries and other
concerted action, of mutual control and instruction.  A
teachable type of life had come into the world.
</p>

<p>
The earliest mammals of the Cainozoic period are but little
superior in brain size to the more active carnivorous
dinosaurs, but as we read on through the record towards
modern times we find, in every tribe and race of the
mammalian animals, a steady universal increase in brain
capacity.  For instance we find at a comparatively early
stage that rhinoceros-like beasts appear.  There is a
creature, the Titanotherium, which lived in the earliest
division of this period.  It was probably very like a modern
rhinoceros in its habits and needs.  But its brain capacity
was not one tenth that of its living successor.
</p>

<p>
The earlier mammals probably parted from their offspring as
soon as suckling was over, but, once the capacity for mutual
understanding has arisen, the advantages of continuing the
association are very great; and we presently find a number of
mammalian species displaying the beginnings of a true social
life and keeping together in herds, packs and flocks,
watching each other, imitating each other, taking warning
from each other&rsquo;s acts and cries.  This is something
that the world had not seen before among vertebrated animals.
  Reptiles and fish may no doubt be found in swarms and
shoals; they have been hatched in quantities and similar
conditions have kept them together, but in the case of the
social and gregarious mammals the association arises not
simply from a community of external forces, it is sustained
by an inner impulse.  They are not merely like one another
and so found in the same places at the same times; they like
one another and so they keep together.

This difference between the reptile world and the world of
our human minds is one our sympathies seem unable to pass.
  We cannot conceive in ourselves the swift uncomplicated
urgency of a reptile&rsquo;s instinctive motives, its
appetites, fears and hates.  We <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P41"></a>41}</span>cannot understand them in their
simplicity because all our motives are complicated;
our&rsquo;s are balances and resultants and not simple
urgencies.  But the mammals and birds have self-restraint and
consideration for other individuals, a social appeal, a self-
control that is, at its lower level, after our own fashion.
  We can in consequence establish relations with almost all
sorts of them.  When they suffer they utter cries and make
movements that rouse our feelings.  We can make understanding
pets of them with a mutual recognition.  They can be tamed to
self-restraint towards us, domesticated and taught.

That unusual growth of brain which is the central fact of
Cainozoic times marks a new communication and interdependence
of individuals.  It foreshadows the development of human
societies of which we shall soon be telling.
</p>

<p>
As the Cainozoic period unrolled, the resemblance of its
flora and fauna to the plants and animals that inhabit the
world to-day <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P42"></a>42}</span>increased.  The big clumsy
Uintatheres and Titanotheres, the Entelodonts and Hyracodons,
big clumsy brutes like nothing living, disappeared.  On the
other hand a series of forms led up by steady degrees from
grotesque and clumsy predecessors to the giraffes, camels,
horses, elephants, deer, dogs and lions and tigers of the
existing world.  The evolution of the horse is particularly
legible upon the geological record.  We have a fairly
complete series of forms from a small tapir-like ancestor in
the early Cainozoic.  Another line of development that has
now been pieced together with some precision is that of the
llamas and camels.

<h4 align="center">MONKEYS, APES AND SUB-MEN</h4>

<p>
NATURALISTS divide the class <i>Mammalia</i> into a number of
orders.  At the head of these is the order <i>Primates</i>,
which includes the lemurs, the monkeys, apes and man.  Their
classification was based originally upon anatomical
resemblances and took no account of any mental qualities.
</p>

<p>
Now the past history of the Primates is one very difficult to
decipher in the geological record.  They are for the most
part animals which live in forests like the lemurs and
monkeys or in bare rocky places like the baboons.  They are
rarely drowned and covered up by sediment, nor are most of
them very numerous species, and so they do not figure so
largely among the fossils as the ancestors of the horses,
camels and so forth do.  But we know that quite early in the
Cainozoic period, that is to say some forty million years ago
or so, primitive monkeys and lemuroid creatures had appeared,
poorer in brain and not so specialized as their later
successors.
</p>

<p>
The great world summer of the middle Cainozoic period drew at
last to an end.  It was to follow those other two great
summers in the history of life, the summer of the Coal Swamps
and the vast summer of the Age of Reptiles.  Once more the
earth spun towards an ice age.  The world chilled, grew
milder for a time and chilled again.  In the warm past
hippopotami had wallowed through a lush sub-tropical
vegetation, and a tremendous tiger with fangs like sabres,
the sabre-toothed tiger, had hunted its prey where now the
journalists of Fleet Street go to and fro.  Now came a
bleaker age and still bleaker ages.  A great weeding and
extinction of species occurred.  A woolly rhinoceros, adapted
to a cold climate, and the mammoth, a big woolly cousin of
the elephants, the Arctic musk ox and the reindeer passed
across the scene.  Then century by century the Arctic ice
cap, the wintry death of the great Ice Age, crept <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P44"></a>44}</span>southward.  In
England it came almost down to the Thames, in America it
reached Ohio.  There would be warmer spells of a few thousand
years and relapses towards a bitterer cold.
</p>

<p>
Geologists talk of these wintry phases as the First, Second,
Third and Fourth Glacial Ages, and of the interludes as
Interglacial periods.  We live to-day in a world that is
still impoverished and scarred by that terrible winter.  The
First Glacial Age was coming on 600,000 years ago; the Fourth
Glacial Age reached its bitterest some fifty thousand years
ago.  And it was amidst the snows of this long universal
winter that the first man-like beings lived upon our planet.

By the middle Cainozoic period there have appeared various
apes with many quasi-human attributes of the jaws and leg
bones, but it is only as we approach these Glacial Ages that
we find traces of creatures that we can speak of as
&ldquo;almost human.&rdquo;  These traces are not bones but
implements.  In Europe, in deposits of this period, between
half a million and a million years old, we find flints <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P45"></a>45}</span>and stones that
have evidently been chipped intentionally by some handy
creature desirous of hammering, scraping or fighting with the
sharpened edge.  These things have been called
&ldquo;Eoliths&rdquo; (dawn stones).  In Europe there are no
bones nor other remains of the creature which made these
objects, simply the objects themselves.  For all the
certainty we have it may have been some entirely un-human but
intelligent monkey.  But at Trinil in Java, in accumulations
of this age, a piece of a skull and various teeth and bones
have been found of a sort of ape man, with a brain case
bigger than that of any living apes, which seems to have
walked erect.  This creature is now called <i>Pithecanthropus
erectus</i>, the walking ape man, and the little trayful of
its bones is the only help our imaginations have as yet in
figuring to, ourselves the makers of the Eoliths.

It is not until we come to sands that are almost a quarter of
a million years old that we find any other particle of a sub-
human being.  But there are plenty of implements, and they
are steadily improving in quality as we read on through the
record.  They are no longer clumsy Eoliths; they are now
shapely instruments made with considerable skill.  <i>And
they are much bigger than the similar implements afterwards
made by true man.</i>  Then, in a sandpit at Heidelberg,
appears a single quasi-human jaw-bone, a clumsy jaw-bone,
absolutely chinless, far heavier than a true human jaw-bone
and narrower, so that it is improbable the creature&rsquo;s
tongue could have moved about for articulate speech.  On the
strength of this jaw-bone, scientific men suppose this
creature to have been a heavy, almost human monster, possibly
with huge limbs and hands, possibly with a thick felt of
hair, and they call it the Heidelberg Man.

This jaw-bone is, I think, one of the most tormenting objects in the

blurred and tantalizing glimpse of this Thing, shambling
through the bleak wilderness, clambering to avoid the sabre-
toothed tiger, watching the woolly rhinoceros in the woods.
  Then before we can scrutinize the monster, he vanishes.  Yet
the soil is littered abundantly with the indestructible
implements he chipped out for his uses.

Scientific men have named him Eoanthropus, the Dawn Man.  He
stands apart from his kindred; a very different being either
from the Heidelberg creature or from any living ape.  No
other vestige like him is known.  But the gravels and
deposits of from one hundred thousand years onward are
increasingly rich in implements of flint and similar stone.
  And these implements are no longer rude
&ldquo;Eoliths.&rdquo; The arch&#230;ologists are presently
able to distinguish scrapers, borers, knives, darts, throwing
stones and hand axes ....
</p>

<p>
We are drawing very near to man.  In our next section we
shall have to describe the strangest of all these precursors
of humanity, the Neanderthalers, the men who were almost, but
not quite, true men.
</p>

<p>
But it may be well perhaps to state quite clearly here that
no scientific man supposes either of these creatures, the
Heidelberg Man or <i>Eoanthropus</i>, to be direct ancestors
of the men of to-day.  These are, at the closest, related
forms.

<h4 align="center">THE NEANDERTHALER AND THE RHODESIAN
MAN</h4>

<p>

ABOUT fifty or sixty thousand years ago, before the climax of
the Fourth Glacial Age, there lived a creature on earth so
like a man that until a few years ago its remains were
considered to be altogether human.  We have skulls and bones
of it and a great accumulation of the large implements it
made and used.  It made fires.  It sheltered in caves from
the cold.  It probably dressed skins roughly and wore them.
  It was right-handed as men are.
</p>

<p>
Yet now the ethnologists tell us these creatures were not
true men.  They were of a different species of the same
genus.  They had heavy protruding jaws and great brow ridges
above the eyes and very low foreheads.  Their thumbs were not
opposable to the fingers as men&rsquo;s are; their necks were
so poised that they could not turn back their heads and look
up to the sky.  They probably slouched along, head down and
forward.  Their chinless jaw-bones resemble the Heidelberg
jaw-bone and are markedly unlike human jaw-bones.  And there
were great differences from the human pattern in their teeth.
  Their cheek teeth were more complicated in structure than
ours, more complicated and not less so; they had not the long
fangs of our cheek teeth; and also these quasi-men had not
the marked canines (dog teeth) of an ordinary human being.
  The capacity of their skulls was quite human, but the brain
was bigger behind and lower in front than the human brain.
  Their intellectual faculties were differently arranged.  They
were not ancestral to the human line. Mentally and physically
they were upon a different line from the human line.
</p>

<p>
Skulls and bones of this extinct species of man were found at
Neanderthal among other places, and from that place these
strange proto-men have been christened Neanderthal Men, or
<span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P49"></a>49}</span>Neanderthalers. They must have
endured in Europe for many hundreds or even thousands of
years.

At that time the climate and geography of our world was very
different from what they are at the present time. Europe for
example was covered with ice reaching as far south as the
Thames and into Central Germany and Russia; there was no
Channel separating Britain from France; the Mediterranean and
the Red Sea were great valleys, with perhaps a chain of lakes
in their deeper portions, and a great inland sea spread from
the present Black Sea across South Russia and far into
Central Asia.  Spain and all of Europe not actually under ice
consisted of bleak uplands under a harder climate than that
of Labrador, and it was only when North Africa was reached
that one would have found a temperate climate.  Across the
cold steppes of Southern Europe with its sparse arctic
vegetation, drifted such hardy creatures as the woolly
mammoth, and woolly rhinoceros, great oxen and reindeer, no
doubt following the vegetation northward in spring and
southward in autumn.

<p>
Such was
the scene through which the Neanderthaler wandered, gathering
such subsistence as he could from small game or fruits and
berries and roots.  Possibly he was mainly a vegetarian,
chewing twigs and roots.  His level elaborate teeth suggest a
largely vegetarian dietary.  But we also find the long marrow
bones of great animals in his caves, cracked to extract the
marrow.  His weapons could not have been of much avail in
open conflict with great beasts, but it is supposed that he
attacked them with spears at difficult river crossings and
even constructed pitfalls for them.  Possibly he followed the
herds and preyed upon any dead that were killed in fights,
and perhaps he played the part of jackal to the sabre-toothed
tiger which still survived in his day.  Possibly in the
bitter hardships of the Glacial Ages this creature had taken
to attacking animals after long ages of vegetarian
adaptation.
</p>

<p>
We cannot guess what this Neanderthal man looked like. He may
have been very hairy and very unhuman-looking indeed.  It is
even doubtful if he went erect.  He may have used his
knuckles as well as his feet to hold himself up. Probably he
went about <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P51"></a>51}</span>alone or in small family groups.  It
is inferred from the structure of his jaw that he was
incapable of speech as we understand it.
</p>

<p>
For thousands of years these Neanderthalers were the highest
animals that the European area had ever seen; and then some
thirty or thirty-five thousand years ago as the climate grew
warmer a race of kindred beings, more intelligent, knowing
more, talking and co-operating together, came drifting into
the Neanderthaler&rsquo;s world from the south.  They ousted
the Neanderthalers from their caves and squatting places;
they hunted the same food; they probably made war upon their
grisly predecessors and killed them off.  These newcomers
from the south or the east&#8212;for at present we do not
know their region of origin&#8212;who at last drove the
Neanderthalers out of existence altogether, were beings of
our own blood and kin, the first True Men.  Their brain-cases
and thumbs and necks and teeth were anatomically the same as
our own.  In a cave at Cro-Magnon and in another at Grimaldi,
a number of skeletons have been found, the earliest truly
human remains that are so far known.

<p>
So it is our race comes into the Record of the Rocks, and the
story of mankind begins.

The world was growing liker our own in those days though the
climate was still austere.  The glaciers of the Ice Age were
receding in Europe; the reindeer of France and Spain
presently gave way to great herds of horses as grass
increased upon the steppes, and the <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P52"></a>52}</span>mammoth became more and more rare in
southern Europe and finally receded northward altogether ....
</p>

<p>
We do not know where the True Men first originated.  But in
the summer of 1921, an extremely interesting skull was found
together with pieces of a skeleton at Broken Hill in South
Africa, which seems to be a relic of a third sort of man,
intermediate in its characteristics between the Neanderthaler
and the human being.  The brain-case indicates a brain bigger
in front and smaller behind than the Neanderthaler&rsquo;s,
and the skull was poised erect upon the backbone in a quite
human way.  The teeth also and the bones are quite human.
  But the face must have been ape-like with enormous brow
ridges and a ridge along the middle of the skull.  The
creature was indeed a true man, so to speak, with an ape-
like, Neanderthaler face.  This Rhodesian Man is evidently
still closer to real men than the Neanderthal Man.
</p>

<p>
This Rhodesian skull is probably only the second of what in
the end may prove to be a long list of finds of sub-human
species which lived on the earth in the vast interval of time
between the beginnings of the Ice Age and the appearance of
their common heir, and perhaps their common exterminator, the
True Man.  The Rhodesian skull itself may not be very
ancient.  Up to the time of publishing this book there has
been no exact determination of its probable age. It may be
that this sub-human creature survived in South Africa until
quite recent times.

THE earliest signs and traces at present known to science, of
a humanity which is indisputably kindred with ourselves, have
been found in western Europe and particularly in France and
Spain. Bones, weapons, scratchings upon bone and rock, carved
fragments of bone, and paintings in caves and upon rock
surfaces dating. it is supposed. from 30,000 years ago or
more, have been discovered in both these countries. Spain is
at present the richest country in the world in these first
relics of our real human ancestors.
</p>

<p>
Of course our present collections of these things are the
merest beginnings of the accumulations we may hope for in the
future, when there are searchers enough to make a thorough
examination of all possible sources and when other countries
in the world, now inaccessible to arch&#230;ologists, have
been explored in some detail.  The greater part of Africa and
Asia has never even been traversed yet by a trained observer
interested in these matters and free to explore, and we must
be very careful therefore not to conclude that the early true
men were distinctively inhabitants of western Europe or that
they first appeared in that region.
</p>

<p>
In Asia or Africa or submerged beneath the sea of to-day
there may be richer and much earlier deposits of real human
remains than anything that has yet come to light.  I write in
Asia or Africa, and I do not mention America because so far
there have been no finds at all of any of the higher
Primates, either of great apes, sub-men, Neanderthalers nor
early true men.  This development of life seems to have been
an exclusively old world development, and it was only
apparently at the end of the Old Stone Age that human beings
first made their way across the land connexion that is now
cut by Behring Straits, into the American continent.

These first real human beings we know of in Europe appear already
to have belonged to one or other of at least two very
distinct races. One of these races was of a very high type
indeed; it was tall and big brained.  One of the
women&rsquo;s skulls found exceeds in capacity that of the
average man of to-day.  One of the men&rsquo;s skeletons is
over six feet in height.  The physical type resembled that of
the North American Indian.  From the Cro-Magnon cave in which
the first skeletons were found these people have been called
Cro-Magnards.  They were savages, but savages of a high
order.  The second race, the race of the Grimaldi cave
remains, was distinctly negroid in its characters.  Its
nearest living affinities are the Bushmen and Hottentots of
South Africa.  It is interesting to find at the very outset
of the known human story, that mankind was already racially
divided into at least two main varieties; and one is tempted
to such unwarrantable guesses as that the former race was
probably brownish rather than black and that it came from the
East or North, and that the latter was blackish rather than
brown and came from the equatorial south.

figures on rocks and bones, and painted rude but often very
able sketches of beasts and the like upon the smooth walls of
caves and upon inviting rock surfaces.  They made a great
variety of implements, much smaller in scale and finer than
those of the Neanderthal men.  We have now in our museums
great quantities of their implements, their statuettes, their
rock drawings and the like.
</p>

<p>
The earliest of them were hunters.  Their chief pursuit was
the wild horse, the little bearded pony of that time.  They
followed it as it moved after pasture.  And also they
followed the bison.  They knew the mammoth, because they have
left us strikingly effective pictures of that creature.  To
judge by one rather ambiguous drawing they trapped and killed
it.
</p>

<p>
They hunted with spears and throwing stones.  They do not
seem to have had the bow, and it is doubtful if they had yet
learnt to tame any animals.  They had no dogs.  There is one
carving of a horse&rsquo;s head and one or two drawings that
suggest a bridled horse, with a twisted skin or tendon round
it.  But the little horses of that age and region could not
have carried a man, and if the horse was domesticated it was
used as a led horse.  It is doubtful and improbable that they
had yet learnt the rather unnatural use of animal&rsquo;s
milk as food.
</p>

<p>
They do not seem to have erected any buildings though they
may have had tents of skins, and though they made clay
figures they never rose to the making of pottery.  Since they
had no cooking implements their cookery must have been
rudimentary or nonexistent.  They knew nothing of cultivation
and nothing of any sort of basket work or woven cloth. Except
for their robes of skin or fur they were naked painted
savages.
</p>

<p>
These earliest known men hunted the open steppes of Europe
for a hundred centuries perhaps, and then slowly drifted and
changed before a change of climate.  Europe, century by
century, was growing milder and damper. Reindeer receded
northward and eastward, and bison and horse followed.  The
steppes gave way to forests, and red deer took the place of
horse and bison. There is a <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P57"></a>57}</span>change in the character of the
implements with this change in their application.  River and
lake fishing becomes of great importance to men, and fine
implements of bone increased.  &ldquo;The bone needles of
this age,&rdquo; says de Mortillet, &ldquo;are much superior
to those of later, even historical times, down to the
Renaissance.  The Romans, for example, never had needles
comparable to those of this epoch.&rdquo;

Almost fifteen or twelve thousand years ago a fresh people
drifted into the south of Spain, and left very remarkable
drawings of themselves upon exposed rock faces there.  These
were the Azilians (named from the Mas d&rsquo;Azil cave).
  They had the bow; they seem to have worn feather headdresses;
they drew vividly; but also they had reduced their drawings
to a sort of symbolism&#8212;a man for instance would be
represented by a vertical dab with two or three horizontal
dabs&#8212;that suggest the dawn of the writing idea.
  Against hunting sketches there are often marks like tallies.
  One drawing shows two men smoking out a bees&rsquo; nest.

Europe, men have learnt not only to chip but to polish and
grind stone implements, and they have begun cultivation.  The
Neolithic Age (New Stone Age) was beginning.

<p>
It is interesting to note that less than a century ago there
still survived in a remote part of the world, in Tasmania, a
race of human beings at a lower level of physical and
intellectual development than any of these earliest races of
mankind who have left traces in Europe.  These people had
long ago been cut off by geographical changes from the rest
of the species, and from stimulation and improvement.  They
seem to have degenerated rather than developed.  They lived a
base life subsisting upon shellfish and small game.  They had
no habitations but only squatting places.  They were real men
of our species, but they had neither the manual dexterity nor
the artistic powers of the first true men.

<h4 align="center">PRIMITIVE THOUGHT</h4>

<p>

AND now let us indulge in a very interesting speculation; how
did it feel to be a man in those early days of the human
adventure?  How did men think and what did they think in
those remote days of hunting and wandering four hundred
centuries ago before seed time and harvest began.  Those were
days long before the written record of any human impressions,
and we are left almost entirely to inference and guesswork in
our answers to these questions.
</p>

<p>
The sources to which scientific men have gone in their
attempts to reconstruct that primitive mentality are very
various.  Recently the science of psycho-analysis, which
analyzes the way in which the egotistic and passionate
impulses of the child are restrained, suppressed, modified or
overlaid, to adapt them to the needs of social life, seems to
have thrown a considerable amount of light upon the history
of primitive society; and another fruitful source of
suggestion has been the study of the ideas and customs of
such contemporary savages as still survive.  Again there is a
sort of mental fossilization which we find in folk-lore and
the deep-lying irrational superstitions and prejudices that
still survive among modern civilized people.  And finally we
have in the increasingly numerous pictures, statues,
carvings, symbols and the like, as we draw near to our own
time, clearer and clearer indications of what man found
interesting and worthy of record and representation.
</p>

<p>
Primitive man probably thought very much as a child thinks,
that is to say in a series of imaginative pictures.  He
conjured up images or images presented themselves to his
mind, and he acted in accordance with the emotions they
aroused.  So a child or an uneducated person does to-day.
  Systematic thinking is apparently a comparatively late
development in human experience; it has not <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P61"></a>61}</span>played any great
part in human life until within the last three thousand
years.  And even to-day those who really control and order
their thoughts are but a small minority of mankind.  Most of
the world still lives by imagination and passion.
</p>

<p>
Probably the earliest human societies, in the opening stages
of the true human story, were small family groups.  Just as
the flocks and herds of the earlier mammals arose out of
families which remained together and multiplied, so probably
did the earliest tribes.  But before this could happen a
certain restraint upon the primitive egotisms of the
individual had to be established.  The fear of the father and
respect for the mother had to be extended into adult life,
and the natural jealousy of the old man of the group for the
younger males as they grew up had to be mitigated.  The
mother on the other hand was the natural adviser and
protector of the young.  Human social life grew up out of the
reaction between the crude instinct of the young to go off
and pair by themselves as they grew up, on the one hand, and
the dangers and disadvantages of separation on the other.  An
anthropological writer of great genius, J. J. Atkinson, in
his <i>Primal Law</i>, has shown how much of the customary
law of savages, the <i>Tabus</i>, that are so remarkable a
fact in tribal life, can be ascribed to such a mental
adjustment of the needs of the primitive human animal to a
developing social life, and the later work of the psycho-
analysts has done much to confirm his interpretation of these
possibilities.
</p>

<p>
Some speculative writers would have us believe that respect
and fear of the Old Man and the emotional reaction of the
primitive savage to older protective women, exaggerated in
dreams and enriched by fanciful mental play, played a large
part in the beginnings of primitive religion and in the
conception of gods and goddesses.  Associated with this
respect for powerful or helpful personalities was a dread and
exaltation of such personages after their deaths, due to
their reappearance in dreams.  It was easy to believe they
were not truly dead but only fantastically transferred to a
remoteness of greater power.
</p>

<p>
The dreams, imaginations and fears of a child are far more
vivid and real than those of a modern adult, and primitive
man was always something of a child. He was nearer to the
animals <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P62"></a>62}</span>also, and he could suppose them to
have motives and reactions like his own.  He could imagine
animal helpers, animal enemies, animal gods.  One needs to
have been an imaginative child oneself to realize again how
important, significant, portentous or friendly, strangely
shaped rocks, lumps of wood, exceptional trees or the like
may have appeared to the men of the Old Stone Age, and how
dream and fancy would create stories and legends about such
things that would become credible as they told them.  Some of
these stories would be good enough to remember and tell
again.  The women would tell them to the children and so
establish a tradition.  To this day most imaginative children
invent long stories in which some favourite doll or animal or
some fantastic semi-human being figures as the hero, and
primitive man probably did the same&#8212;with a much
stronger disposition to believe his hero real.

For the very earliest of the true men that we know of were
probably quite talkative beings.  In that way they have
differed from the Neanderthalers and had an advantage over
them.  The Neanderthaler may have been a dumb animal. Of
course the primitive <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P63"></a>63}</span>human speech was probably a very
scanty collection of names, and may have been eked out with
gestures and signs.
</p>

<p>
There is no sort of savage so low as not to have a kind of
science of cause and effect.  But primitive man was not very
critical in his associations of cause with effect; he very
easily connected an effect with something quite wrong as its
cause. &ldquo;You do so and so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and so
and so happens.&rdquo;  You give a child a poisonous berry
and it dies.  You eat the heart of a valiant enemy and you
become strong.  There we have two bits of cause and effect
association, one true one false.  We call the system of cause
and effect in the mind of a savage, Fetish; but Fetish is
simply savage science.  It differs from modern science in
that it is totally unsystematic and uncritical and so more
frequently wrong.

<p>
In many cases it is not difficult to link cause and effect,
in <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P64"></a>64}</span>many
others erroneous ideas were soon corrected by experience; but
there was a large series of issues of very great importance
to primitive man, where he sought persistently for causes and
found explanations that were wrong but not sufficiently wrong
nor so obviously wrong as to be detected.  It was a matter of
great importance to him that game should be abundant or fish
plentiful and easily caught, and no doubt he tried and
believed in a thousand charms, incantations and omens to
determine these desirable results.  Another great concern of
his was illness and death.  Occasionally infections crept
through the land and men died of them.  Occasionally men were
stricken by illness and died or were enfeebled without any
manifest cause.  This too must have given the hasty,
emotional mind of primitive man much feverish exercise.
  Dreams and fantastic guesses made him blame this, or appeal
for help to that man or beast or thing.  He had the
child&rsquo;s aptitude for fear and panic.
</p>

<p>
Quite early in the little human tribe, older, steadier minds
sharing the fears, sharing the imaginations, but a little
more forceful than the others, must have asserted themselves,
to advise, to prescribe, to command. This they declared
unpropitious and that imperative, this an omen of good and
that an omen of evil.  The expert in Fetish, the Medicine
Man, was the first priest.  He exhorted, he interpreted
dreams, he warned, he performed the complicated hocus pocus
that brought luck or averted calamity.  Primitive religion
was not so much what we now call religion as practice and
observance, and the early priest dictated what was indeed an
arbitrary primitive practical science.

<h4 align="center">THE BEGINNINGS OF CULTIVATION</h4>

<p>

WE are still very ignorant about the beginnings of
cultivation and settlement in the world although a vast
amount of research and speculation has been given to these
matters in the last fifty years.  All that we can say with
any confidence at present is that somewhen about 15,000 and
12,000 <small>B.C.</small> while the Azilian people
were in the south of Spain and while the remnants of the
earlier hunters were drifting northward and eastward,
somewhere in North Africa or Western Asia or in that great
Mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters
of the Mediterranean sea, there were people who, age by age,
were working out two vitally important things; they were
beginning cultivation and they were domesticating animals.
  They were also beginning to make, in addition to the chipped
implements of their hunter forebears, implements of polished
stone.  They had discovered the possibility of basketwork and
roughly woven textiles of plant fibre, and they were
beginning to make a rudely modelled pottery.
</p>

<p>
They were entering upon a new phase in human culture, the
Neolithic phase (New Stone Age) as distinguished from the
Pal&#230;olithic (Old Stone) phase of the Cro-Magnards, the
Grimaldi people, the Azilians and their like.  [<a
name="chapXIIIfn1text"></a><a href="#chapXIIIfn1">1</a>]
Slowly these Neolithic people spread over the warmer parts of
the world; and the arts they had mastered, the plants and
animals they had learnt to use, spread by imitation and
acquisition even more widely than they did.  By 10,000
 <small>B.C.</small>, most of mankind was at the Neolithic
level.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P66"></a>66}</span>Now the
ploughing of land, the sowing of seed, the reaping of
harvest, threshing and grinding, may seem the most obviously
reasonable steps to a modern mind just as to a modern mind it
is a commonplace that the world is round.  What else could
you do? people will ask.  What else can it be?  But to the
primitive man of twenty thousand years ago neither of the
systems of action and reasoning that seem so sure and
manifest to us to-day were at all obvious.  He felt his way
to effectual practice through a multitude of trials and
misconceptions, with fantastic and unnecessary elaborations
and false interpretations at every turn.  Somewhere in the
Mediterranean region, wheat grew wild; and man may have
learnt to pound and then grind up its seeds for food long
before he learnt to sow.  He reaped before he sowed.
</p>

<p>
And it is a very remarkable thing that throughout the world
wherever there is sowing and harvesting there is still
traceable the vestiges of a strong primitive association of
the idea of sowing with the idea of a blood sacrifice, and
primarily of the sacrifice of a human being.  The study of
the original entanglement of these two things is a profoundly
attractive one to the curious mind; the interested reader
will find it very fully developed in that monumental work,
Sir J. G. Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden Bough</i>.  It was an
entanglement, we must remember, in the childish, dreaming,
myth-making primitive mind; no reasoned process will explain
it.  But in that world of 12,000 to 20,000 years ago, it
would seem that whenever seed time came round to the
Neolithic peoples there was a human sacrifice.  And it was
not the sacrifice of any mean or outcast person; it was the
sacrifice usually of a chosen youth or maiden, a youth more
often who was treated with profound deference and even
worship up to the moment of his immolation.  He was a sort of
sacrificial god-king, and all the details of his killing had
become a ritual directed by the old, knowing men and
sanctioned by the accumulated usage of ages.

<p>
At first primitive men, with only a very rough idea of the
seasons, must have found great difficulty in determining when
was the propitious moment for the seed-time sacrifice and the
sowing.  There is some reason for supposing that there was an
early stage in human experience when men had no idea of a
year. The first <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P68"></a>68}</span>chronology was in lunar months; it
is supposed that the years of the Biblical patriarchs are
really moons, and the Babylonian calendar shows distinct
traces of an attempt to reckon seed time by taking thirteen
lunar months to see it round. This lunar influence upon the
calendar reaches down to our own days. If usage did not dull
our sense of its strangeness we should think it a very
remarkable thing indeed that the Christian Church does not
commemorate the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ on the
proper anniversaries but on dates that vary year by year with
the phases of the moon.
</p>

<p>
It may be doubted whether the first agriculturalists made any
observation of the stars.  It is more likely that stars were
first observed by migratory herdsmen, who found them a
convenient mark of direction.  But once their use in
determining seasons was realized, their importance to
agriculture became very great.  The seed-time sacrifice was
linked up with the southing or northing of some prominent
star.  A myth and worship of that star was for primitive man
an almost inevitable consequence.

It is easy to see how important the man of knowledge and
experience, the man who knew about the blood sacrifice and
the stars, became in this early Neolithic world.
</p>

<p>
The fear of uncleanness and pollution, and the methods of
cleansing that were advisable, constituted another source of
power for the knowledgeable men and women. For there have
always been witches as well as wizards, and priestesses as
well as priests.  The early priest was really not so much a
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P69"></a>69}</span>religious
man as a man of applied science.  His science was generally
empirical and often bad; he kept it secret from the
generality of men very jealously; but that does not alter the
fact that his primary function was knowledge and that his
primary use was a practical use.

<p>
Twelve or fifteen thousand years ago, in all the warm and
fairly well-watered parts of the Old World these Neolithic
human communities, with their class and tradition of priests
and priestesses and their cultivated fields and their
development of villages and little walled cities, were
spreading.  Age by age a drift and exchange of ideas went on
between these communities.  Eliot Smith and Rivers have used
the term &ldquo;Heliolithic culture&rdquo; for the culture of
these first agricultural peoples.  &ldquo;Heliolithic&rdquo;
(Sun and Stone) is not perhaps the best possible word to use
for this, but until scientific men give us a better one we
shall have to use it.  Originating somewhere in the
Mediterranean and western Asiatic area, it spread age by age
eastward and from island to island across the Pacific until
it may even have reached America and mingled with the more
primitive ways of living of the Mongoloid immigrants coming
down from the North.
</p>

<p>
Wherever the brownish people with the Heliolithic culture
went they took with them all or most of a certain group of
curious ideas and practices.  Some of them are such queer
ideas that they call for the explanation of the mental
expert.  They made pyramids <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P70"></a>70}</span>and great mounds, and set up great
circles of big stones, perhaps to facilitate the astronomical
observation of the priests; they made mummies of some or all
of their dead; they tattooed and circumcized; they had the
old custom, known as the <i>couvade</i>, of sending the
<i>father</i> to bed and rest when a child was born, and they
had as a luck symbol the well-known Swastika.
</p>

<p>
If we were to make a map of the world with dots to show how
far these group practices have left their traces, we should
make a belt along the temperate and sub-tropical coasts of
the world from Stonehenge and Spain across the world to
Mexico and Peru.  But Africa below the equator, north central
Europe, and north Asia would show none of these dottings;
there lived races who were developing along practically
independent lines.

[<a href="#chapXIIIfn1text">1</a>] The term Pal&#230;olithic

<p>

ABOUT 10,000 <small>B.C.</small> the geography of
the world was very similar in its general outline to that of
the world to-day.  It is probable that by that time the great
barrier across the Straits of Gibraltar that had hitherto
banked back the ocean waters from the Mediterranean valley
had been eaten through, and that the Mediterranean was a sea
following much the same coastlines as it does now.  The
Caspian Sea was probably still far more extensive than it is
at present, and it may have been continuous with the Black
Sea to the north of the Caucasus Mountains.  About this great
Central Asian sea lands that are now steppes and deserts were
fertile and habitable.  Generally it was a moister and more
fertile world.  European Russia was much more a land of swamp
and lake than it is now, and there may still have been a land
connexion between Asia and America at Behring Straits.
</p>

<p>
It would have been already possible at that time to have
distinguished the main racial divisions of mankind as we know
them to-day.  Across the warm temperate regions of this
rather warmer and better-wooded world, and along the coasts,
stretched the brownish peoples of the Heliolithic culture,
the ancestors of the bulk of the living inhabitants of the
Mediterranean world, of the Berbers, the Egyptians and of
much of the population of South and Eastern Asia.  This great
race had of course a number of varieties.  The Iberian or
Mediterranean or &ldquo;dark-white&rdquo; race of the
Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, the &ldquo;Hamitic&rdquo;
peoples which include the Berbers and Egyptians, the
Dravidians; the darker people of India, a multitude of East
Indian people, many Polynesian races and the Maoris are all
divisions of various value of this great main mass of
humanity.  Its western varieties are whiter than its eastern.
</p>

<p>
In the forests of central and northern Europe a more blonde
variety <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P72"></a>72}</span>of
men with blue eyes was becoming distinguishable, branching
off from the main mass of brownish people, a variety which
many people now speak of as the Nordic race.  In the more
open regions of northeastern Asia was another differentiation
of this brownish humanity in the direction of a type with
more oblique eyes, high cheek-bones, a yellowish skin, and
very straight black hair, the Mongolian peoples.  In South
Africa, Australia, in many tropical islands in the south of
Asia were remains of the early negroid peoples. The central
parts of Africa were already a region of racial intermixture.
  Nearly all the coloured races of Africa to-day seem to be
blends of the brownish peoples of the north with a negroid
substratum.

do.  Human races do not branch out like trees with branches
that never come together again.  It is a thing we need to
bear constantly in mind, this remingling of races at any
opportunity.  It will save us from many cruel delusions and

in the loosest manner, and base the most preposterous
generalizations upon it.  They will speak of a
&ldquo;British&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">{<a

race.  But nearly all the European nations are confused

<p>
It was at the Neolithic phase of human development that
peoples of the Mongolian breed first made their way into
America.  Apparently they came by way of Behring Straits and
spread southward.  They found caribou, the American reindeer,
in the north and great <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P74"></a>74}</span>herds of bison in the south.  When
they reached South America there were still living the
Glyptodon, a gigantic armadillo, and the Megatherium, a
monstrous clumsy sloth as high as an elephant.  They probably
exterminated the latter beast, which was as helpless as it
was big.
</p>

<p>
The greater portion of these American tribes never rose above
a hunting nomadic Neolithic life.  They never discovered the
use of iron, and their chief metal possessions were native
gold and copper.  But in Mexico, Yucatan and Peru conditions
existed favourable to settled cultivation, and here about
1000 <small>B.C.</small> or so arose very
interesting civilizations of a parallel but different type
from the old-world civilization.  Like the much earlier
primitive civilizations of the old world these communities
displayed a great development of human sacrifice about the
processes of seed time and harvest; but while in the old
world, as we shall see, these primary ideas were ultimately
mitigated, complicated and overlaid by others, in America
they developed and were elaborated, to a very high degree of
intensity.  These American civilized countries were
essentially priest-ruled countries; their war chiefs and
rulers were under a rigorous rule of law and omen.
</p>

<p>
These priests carried astronomical science to a high level of
accuracy.  They knew their year better than the Babylonians
of whom we shall presently tell.  In Yucatan they had a kind
of writing, the Maya writing, of the most curious and
elaborate character.  So far as we have been able to decipher
it, it was used mainly for keeping the exact and complicated
calendars upon which the priests expended their intelligence.
  The art of the Maya civilization came to a climax about 700
or 800 <small>A.D.</small>  The sculptured work of
these people amazes the modern observer by its great plastic
power and its frequent beauty, and perplexes him by a
grotesqueness and by a sort of insane conventionality and
intricacy outside the circle of his ideas.  There is nothing
quite like it in the old world.  The nearest approach, and
that is a remote one, is found in archaic Indian carvings.
  Everywhere there are woven feathers and serpents twine in and
out.  Many Maya inscriptions resemble a certain sort of
elaborate drawing made by lunatics in European asylums, more
than any other old-world work.  It is as if the Maya mind
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P75"></a>75}</span>had
developed upon a different line from the old-world mind, had
a different twist to its ideas, was not, by old-world
standards, a rational mind at all.
</p>

<p>
This linking of these aberrant American civilizations to the
idea of a general mental aberration finds support in their
extraordinary obsession by the shedding of human blood.  The
Mexican civilization in particular ran blood; it offered
thousands of human victims yearly.  The cutting open of
living victims, the tearing out of the still beating heart,
was an act that dominated the minds and lives of these
strange priesthoods.  The public life, the national
festivities all turned on this fantastically horrible act.

<p>
The ordinary existence of the common people in these
communities was very like the ordinary existence of any other
barbaric peasantry.  Their pottery, weaving and dyeing was
very good.  The Maya writing was not only carven on stone but
written and painted upon skins and the like.  The European
and American museums contain many enigmatical Maya
manuscripts of which at present little has been deciphered
except the dates.  In Peru there were beginnings of a similar
writing but they were superseded by a method of keeping
records by knotting <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P76"></a>76}</span>cords.  A similar method of
mnemonics was in use in China thousands of years ago.
</p>

<p>
In the old world before 4000 or 5000
 <small>B.C.</small>, that is to say three or four thousand years
earlier, there were primitive civilizations not unlike these
American civilizations; civilizations based upon a temple,
having a vast quantity of blood sacrifices and with an
intensely astronomical priesthood.  But in the old world the
primitive civilizations reacted upon one another and
developed towards the conditions of our own world.  In
America these primitive civilizations never progressed beyond
this primitive stage.  Each of them was in a little world of
its own.  Mexico it seems knew little or nothing of Peru,
until the Europeans came to America.  The potato, which was
the principal food stuff in Peru, was unknown in Mexico.
</p>

<p>
Age by age these peoples lived and marvelled at their gods
and made their sacrifices and died.  Maya art rose to high
levels of decorative beauty.  Men made love and tribes made
war.  Drought and plenty, pestilence and health, followed one
another.  The priests elaborated their calendar and their
sacrificial ritual through long centuries, but made little
progress in other directions.

<h4 align="center">SUMERIA, EARLY EGYPT AND WRITING</h4>

<p>

THE old world is a wider, more varied stage than the new.  By
6000 or 7000 <small>B.C.</small> there were already
quasi-civilized communities almost at the Peruvian level,
appearing in various fertile regions of Asia and in the Nile
valley.  At that time north Persia and western Turkestan and
south Arabia were all more fertile than they are now, and
there are traces of very early communities in these regions.
  It is in lower Mesopotamia however and in Egypt that there
first appear cities, temples, systematic irrigation, and
evidences of a social organization rising above the level of
a mere barbaric village-town.  In those days the Euphrates
and Tigris flowed by separate mouths into the Persian Gulf,
and it was in the country between them that the Sumerians
built their first cities.  About the same time, for
chronology is still vague, the great history of Egypt was
beginning.
</p>

<p>
These Sumerians appear to have been a brownish people with
prominent noses.  They employed a sort of writing that has
been deciphered, and their language is now known.  They had
discovered the use of bronze and they built great tower-like
temples of sun-dried brick. The clay of this country is very
fine; they used it to write upon, and so it is that their
inscriptions have been preserved to us.  They had cattle,
sheep, goats and asses, but no horses.  They fought on foot,
in close formation, carrying spears and shields of skin.
  Their clothing was of wool and they shaved their heads.
</p>

<p>
Each of the Sumerian cities seems generally to have been an
independent state with a god of its own and priests of its
own.  But sometimes one city would establish an ascendancy
over others and exact tribute from their population.  A very
ancient inscription <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P78"></a>78}</span>at Nippur records the
&ldquo;empire,&rdquo; the first recorded empire, of the
Sumerian city of Erech.  Its god and its priest-king claimed
an authority from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea.

<p>
At first writing was merely an abbreviated method of
pictorial record.  Even before Neolithic times men were
beginning to write.  The Azilian rock pictures to which we
have already referred show the beginning of the process.
  Many of them record hunts and expeditions, and in most of
these the human figures are plainly drawn.  But in some the
painter would not bother with head and limbs; he just
indicated men by a vertical and one or two transverse
strokes.  From this to a conventional condensed picture
writing was an easy transition.  In Sumeria, where the
writing was done on clay with a stick, the dabs of the
characters soon became unrecognizably unlike the things they
stood for, but in Egypt where men painted on walls and on
strips of the papyrus reed (the first paper) the likeness to
the thing imitated remained.  From the fact that the wooden
styles used in Sumeria made wedge-shaped marks, the Sumerian
writing is called cuneiform (= wedge-shaped).

<p>
An important step towards writing was made when pictures were
used to indicate not the thing represented but some similar
thing.  In the rebus dear to children of a suitable age, this
is still done to-day.  We draw a camp with tents and a bell,
and the child is delighted to guess that this is the Scotch
name Campbell.  The Sumerian language was a language made up
of accumulated syllables rather like some contemporary
Amerindian languages, and it lent itself very readily to this
syllabic method of writing words expressing ideas that could
not be conveyed by pictures directly.  Egyptian writing
underwent parallel developments.  Later on, when foreign
peoples with less distinctly syllabled methods of speech were
to learn and use these picture scripts they were to make
those further modifications and simplifications that
developed at last into alphabetical writing.  All the true
alphabets of the later world derived from a mixture of the
Sumerian cuneiform and the Egyptian hieroglyphic (priest
writing).  Later in China there was to develop a
conventionalized picture writing, but in China it never got
to the alphabetical stage.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P80"></a>80}</span>The
invention of writing was of very great importance in the
development of human societies.  It put agreements, laws,
commandments on record.  It made the growth of states larger
than the old city states possible.  It made a continuous
historical consciousness possible.  The command of the priest
or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice
and could survive his death.  It is interesting to note that
in ancient Sumeria seals were greatly used.  A king or a
nobleman or a merchant would have his seal often very
artistically carved, and would impress it on any clay
document he wished to authorize.  So close had civilization
got to printing six thousand years ago.  Then the clay was
dried hard and became permanent.  For the reader must
remember that in the land of Mesopotamia for countless years,
letters, records and accounts were all written on
comparatively indestructible tiles.  To that fact we owe a
great wealth of recovered knowledge.

<p>
Daily life in those first city lands of the old world must
have been <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P83"></a>83}</span>very similar in both Egypt and
Sumeria.  And except for the asses and cattle in the streets
it must have been not unlike the life in the Maya cities of
America three or four thousand years later.  Most of the
people in peace time were busy with irrigation and
cultivation&#8212;except on days of religious festivity.
  They had no money and no need for it.  They managed their
small occasional trades by barter.  The princes and rulers
who alone had more than a few possessions used gold and
silver bars and precious stones for any incidental act of
trade.  The temple dominated life; in Sumeria it was a great
towering temple that went up to a roof from which the stars
were observed; in Egypt it was a massive building with only a
ground floor. In Sumeria the priest ruler was the greatest,
most splendid of beings.  In Egypt however there was one who
was raised above the priests; he was the living incarnation
of the chief god of the land, the Pharaoh, the god king.
</p>

<p>
There were few changes in the world in those days;
men&rsquo;s days were sunny, toilsome and conventional.  Few
strangers came into the land and such as did fared
uncomfortably.  The priest directed life according to
immemorial rules and watched the stars for seed time and
marked the omens of the sacrifices and interpreted the
warnings of dreams.  Men worked and loved and died, not
unhappily, forgetful of the savage past of their race and
heedless of its future.  Sometimes the ruler was benign.
  Such was Pepi II, who reigned in Egypt for ninety years.
  Sometimes he was ambitious and took men&rsquo;s sons to be
soldiers and sent them against neighbouring city states to
war and plunder, or he made them toil to build great
buildings.  Such were Cheops and Chephren and Mycerinus, who
built those vast sepulchral piles, the pyramids at Gizeh.
  The largest of these is 450 feet high and the weight of stone
in it is 4,883,000 tons.  All this was brought down the Nile
in boats and lugged into place chiefly by human muscle.  Its
erection must have exhausted Egypt more than a great war
would have done.

<h4 align="center">PRIMITIVE NOMADIC PEOPLES</h4>

<p>

IT was not only in Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley that men
were settling down to agriculture and the formation of city
states in the centuries between 6000 and 8000
 <small>B.C.</small>  Wherever there were possibilities of
irrigation and a steady all-the-year-round food supply men
were exchanging the uncertainties and hardships of hunting
and wandering for the routines of settlement.  On the upper
Tigris a people called the Assyrians were founding cities; in
the valleys of Asia Minor and on the Mediterranean shores and
islands, there were small communities growing up to
civilization.  Possibly parallel developments of human life
were already going on in favourable regions of India, and
China.  In many parts of Europe where there were lakes well
stocked with fish, little communities of men had long settled
in dwellings built on piles over the water, and were eking
out agriculture by fishing and hunting. But over much larger
areas of the old world no such settlement was possible.  The
land was too harsh, too thickly wooded or too arid, or the
seasons too uncertain for mankind, with only the implements
and science of that age to take root.
</p>

<p>
For settlement under the conditions of the primitive
civilizations men needed a constant water supply and warmth
and sunshine.  Where these needs were not satisfied, man
could live as a transient, as a hunter following his game, as
a herdsman following the seasonal grass, but he could not
settle.  The transition from the hunting to the herding life
may have been very gradual.  From following herds of wild
cattle or (in Asia) wild horses, men may have come to an idea
of property in them, have learnt to pen them into valleys,
have fought for them against wolves, wild dogs and other
predatory beasts.

So while the
primitive civilizations of the cultivators were growing up
chiefly in the great river valleys, a different way of
living, the nomadic life, a life in constant movement to and
fro from winter pasture to summer pasture, was also growing
up.  The nomadic peoples were on the whole hardier than the
agriculturalists; they were less prolific and numerous, they
had no permanent temples and no highly organized priesthood;
they had less gear; but the reader must not suppose that
theirs was necessarily a less highly developed way of living
on that account.  In many ways this free life was a fuller
life than that of the tillers of the soil.  The individual
was more self-reliant; less of a unit in a crowd.  The leader
was more important; the medicine man perhaps less so.

Moving over large stretches of country the nomad took a wider view
of life.  He touched on the confines of this settled land and
that.  He was used to the sight of strange faces.  He had to
scheme and treat for pasture with competing tribes.  He knew
more of minerals than the folk upon the plough lands because
he went over mountain passes and into rocky places.  He may
have been a better metallurgist.  Possibly bronze and much
more probably iron smelting were nomadic discoveries.  Some
of the earliest implements of iron reduced from its ores have
been found in Central Europe far away from the early
civilizations.

<p>
On the other hand the settled folk had their textiles and
their pottery and made many desirable things.  It was
inevitable that as the two sorts of life, the agricultural
and the nomadic differentiated, a certain amount of looting
and trading should develop between the two.  In Sumeria
particularly which had deserts and seasonal <span

either hand it must have been usual to have the nomads
camping close to the cultivated fields, trading and stealing
and perhaps tinkering, as gipsies do to this day.  (But hens
they would not steal, because the domestic fowl&#8212;an
Indian jungle fowl originally was not domesticated by man
until about 1000 <small>B.C.</small>)  They would
bring precious stones and things of metal and leather.  If
they were hunters they would bring skins.  They would get in
exchange pottery and beads and glass, garments and suchlike
manufactured things.

Three main regions and three main kinds of wandering and
imperfectly settled people there were in those remote days of
the first civilizations in Sumeria and early Egypt.  Away in
the forests of Europe were the blonde Nordic peoples, hunters
and herdsmen, a lowly race.  The primitive civilizations saw
very little of this race before 1500
 <small>B.C.</small>  Away on the steppes of eastern Asia various
Mongolian tribes, the Hunnish peoples, were domesticating the
horse and developing a very wide sweeping habit of seasonal
movement between their summer and winter camping places.
  Possibly the Nordic and Hunnish peoples were still separated
from one another by the swamps of Russia and the greater
Caspian Sea of that time.  For very much of Russia there was
swamp and lake.  In the deserts, which were growing more arid
now, of Syria and Arabia, tribes of a dark white or brownish
people, the Semitic tribes, were driving flocks of sheep and
goats and asses from pasture to pasture.  It was these
Semitic shepherds and certain more negroid people from
southern Persia, the Elamites, who were the first nomads to
come into close contact with the early civilizations.  They
came <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P90"></a>90}</span>as
 traders and as raiders.  Finally there arose leaders among them
 with bolder imaginations, and they became conquerors.

<p>
About 2750 <small>B.C.</small> a great Semitic
leader, Sargon, had conquered the whole Sumerian land and was
master of all the world from the Persian Gulf to the
Mediterranean Sea.  He was an illiterate barbarian and his
people, the Akkadians, learnt the Sumerian writing and
adopted the Sumerian language as the speech of the officials
and the learned.  The empire he founded decayed after two
centuries, and after one inundation of Elamites a fresh
Semitic people, the Amorites, by degrees established their
rule over Sumeria.  They made their capital in what had
hitherto been a small up-river town, Babylon, and their
empire is called the first Babylonian Empire.  It was
consolidated by a great king called Hammurabi (circa 2100
<small>B.C.</small>) who made the earliest code of
laws yet known to history.
</p>

<p>
The narrow valley of the Nile lies less open to nomadic
invasion than Mesopotamia, but about the time of Hammurabi
occurred a successful Semitic invasion of Egypt and a line of
Pharaohs was set up, the Hyksos or &ldquo;shepherd
kings,&rdquo; which lasted for several centuries.  These
Semitic conquerors never assimilated themselves with the
Egyptians; they were always regarded with hostility as
foreigners and barbarians; and they were at last expelled by
a popular uprising about 1600 <small>B.C.</small>
</p>

<p>
But the Semites had come into Sumeria for good and all, the
two races assimilated and the Babylonian Empire became
Semitic in its language and character.

THE earliest boats and ships must have come into use some
twenty-five or thirty thousand years ago.  Man was probably
paddling about on the water with a log of wood or an inflated
skin to assist him, at latest in the beginnings of the
Neolithic period.  A basketwork boat covered with skin and
caulked was used in Egypt and Sumeria from the beginnings of
our knowledge.  Such boats are still used there.  They are
used to this day in Ireland and Wales and in Alaska; sealskin
boats still make the crossing of Behring Straits.  The hollow
log followed as tools improved.  The building of boats and
then ships came in a natural succession.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the legend of Noah&rsquo;s Ark preserves the memory
of some early exploit in shipbuilding, just as the story of
the Flood, so widely distributed among the peoples of the
world, may be the tradition of the flooding of the
Mediterranean basin.
</p>

<p>
There were ships upon the Red Sea long before the pyramids
were built, and there were ships on the Mediterranean and
Persian Gulf by 7000 <small>B.C.</small>  Mostly
these were the ships of fishermen, but some were already
trading and pirate ships&#8212;for knowing what we do of
mankind we may guess pretty safely that the first sailors
plundered where they could and traded where they had to do
so.
</p>

<p>
The seas on which these first ships adventured were inland
seas on which the wind blew fitfully and which were often at
a dead calm for days together, so that sailing did not
develop beyond an accessory use.  It is only in the last four
hundred years that the well-rigged, ocean-going, sailing ship
has developed.  The ships of the ancient world were
essentially rowing ships which hugged the shore and went into
harbour at the first sign of rough weather.  As ships grew
into big galleys they caused a demand for war captives as
galley slaves.
</p>

<p>
We have already noted the appearance of the Semitic people as
wanderers and nomads in the region of Syria and Arabia, and
how they conquered Sumeria and set up first the Akkadian and
then the first Babylonian Empire.  In the west these same
Semitic peoples <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P92"></a>92}</span>were taking to the sea.  They set up
a string of harbour towns along the Eastern coast of the
Mediterranean, of which Tyre and Sidon were the chief; and by
the time of Hammurabi in Babylon, they had spread as traders,
wanderers and colonizers over the whole Mediterranean basin.
  These sea Semites were called the Ph&#339;nicians, They
settled largely in Spain, pushing back the old Iberian Basque
population and sending coasting expeditions through the
straits of Gibraltar; and they set up colonies upon the north
coast of Africa.  Of Carthage, one of these Ph&#339;nician
cities, we shall have much more to tell later.
</p>

<p>
But the Ph&#339;nicians were not the first people to have
galleys in the Mediterranean waters.  There was already a
series of towns and cities among the islands and coasts of
that sea belonging to a race or races apparently connected by
blood and language with the Basques to the west and the
Berbers and Egyptians to the south, the &#198;gean peoples.
  These peoples must not be confused with the Greeks, who come
much later into our story; they were pre-Greek, but they had
cities in Greece and Asia Minor; Mycen&#230; and Troy for
example, and they had a great and prosperous establishment at
Cnossos in Crete.
</p>

<p>
It is only in the last half century that the industry of
excavating arch&#230;ologists has brought the extent and
civilization of the &#198;gean peoples to our knowledge.
  Cnossos has been most thoroughly explored; it was happily not
succeeded by any city big enough to destroy its ruins, and so
it is our chief source of information about this once almost
forgotten civilization.
</p>

<p>
The history of Cnossos goes back as far as the history of
Egypt; the two countries were trading actively across the sea
by 4000 <small>B.C.</small>  By 2500 <small>B.C.</small>,
 that is between the time of Sargon I and
Hammurabi, Cretan civilization was at its zenith.
</p>

<p>
Cnossos was not so much a town as a great palace for the
Cretan monarch and his people.  It was not even fortified.
  It was only fortified later as the Ph&#339;nicians grew
strong, and as a new and more terrible breed of pirates, the
Greeks, came upon the sea from the north.

<p>
The monarch was called Minos, as the Egyptian monarch was
called Pharaoh; and he kept his state in a palace fitted with
running water, with bathrooms and the like conveniences such
as we know of in no other ancient remains.  There he held
great festivals and shows.  There was bull-fighting,
singularly like the bull-fighting that <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P93"></a>93}</span>still survives
in Spain; there was resemblance even in the costumes of the
bull-fighters; and there were gymnastic displays.  The
women&rsquo;s clothes were remarkably modern in spirit; they
wore corsets and flounced dresses.  The pottery, the textile
manufactures, the sculpture, painting, jewellery, ivory,
metal and inlay work of these <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P94"></a>94}</span>Cretans was often astonishingly
beautiful.  And they had a system of writing, but that still
remains to be deciphered.
</p>

<p>
This happy and sunny and civilized life lasted for some score
of centuries.  About 2000 <small>B.C.</small>
Cnossos and Babylon abounded in comfortable and cultivated
people who probably led very pleasant lives.  They had shows
and they had religious festivals, they had domestic slaves to
look after them and industrial slaves to make a profit for
them.  Life must have seemed very secure in Cnossos for such
people, sunlit and girdled by the blue sea.  Egypt of course
must have appeared rather a declining country in those days
under the rule of her half-barbaric shepherd kings, and if
one took an interest in politics one must have noticed how
the Semitic people seemed to be getting everywhere, ruling
Egypt, ruling distant Babylon, building Nineveh on the upper
Tigris, sailing west to the Pillars of Hercules (the straits
of Gibraltar) and setting up their colonies on those distant
coasts.
</p>

<p>
There were some active arid curious minds in Cnossos, because
later on the Greeks told legends of a certain skilful Cretan
artificer, D&#230;dalus, who attempted to make some sort of
flying machine, perhaps a glider, which collapsed and fell
into the sea.

</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note some of the differences as well as
the resemblances between the life of Cnossos and our own.  To
a Cretan gentleman of 2500 <small>B.C.</small> iron
was a rare metal which fell out of the sky and was curious
rather than useful&#8212;for as yet only meteoric iron was
known, iron had not been obtained from its ores.  Compare
that with our modern state of affairs pervaded by iron
everywhere.  The horse again would be a quite legendary
creature to our Cretan, a sort of super-ass which lived in
the bleak northern lands far away beyond the Black Sea.
  Civilization for him dwelt chiefly in &#198;gean Greece and
Asia Minor, where Lydians and Carians and Trojans lived a
life and probably spoke languages like his own.  There were
Ph&#339;nicians and &#198;geans settled in Spain and North
Africa, but those were very remote regions to his
imagination.  Italy was still a desolate land covered with
dense forests; the brown-skinned Etruscans had not yet gone
there from Asia Minor.  And one day perhaps this Cretan
gentleman went down to the harbour and saw a captive who
attracted his attention because he was very fair-complexioned
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P95"></a>95}</span>and had
blue eyes.  Perhaps our Cretan tried to talk to him and was
answered in an unintelligible gibberish.  This creature came
from somewhere beyond the Black Sea and seemed to be an
altogether benighted savage.  But indeed he was an Aryan
tribesman, of a race and culture of which we shall soon have
much to tell, and the strange gibberish he spoke was to
differentiate some day into Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin,
German, English and most of the chief languages of the world.

<p>
Such was Cnossos at its zenith, intelligent, enterprising,
bright and happy.  But about 1400 <small>B.C.</small>
 disaster came perhaps very suddenly upon its
prosperity.  The palace of Minos was destroyed, and its ruins
have never been rebuilt or inhabited from that day to this.
  We do not know how this disaster occurred.  The excavators
note what appears to be scattered plunder and the marks of
the fire.  But the traces of a very destructive earthquake
have also been found.  Nature alone may have destroyed
Cnossos, or the Greeks may have finished what the earthquake
began.

<h4 align="center">EGYPT, BABYLON AND ASSYRIA</h4>

<p>

THE Egyptians had never submitted very willingly to the rule
of their Semitic shepherd kings and about 1600
 <small>A.D.</small> a vigorous patriotic movement expelled these
foreigners.  Followed a new phase or revival for Egypt, a
period known to Egyptologists as the New Empire.  Egypt,
which had not been closely consolidated before the Hyksos
invasion, was now a united country; and the phase of
subjugation and insurrection left her full of military
spirit.  The Pharaohs became aggressive conquerors.  They had
now acquired the war horse and the war chariot, which the
Hyksos had brought to them.  Under Thothmes III and Amenophis
III Egypt had extended her rule into Asia as far as the
Euphrates.
</p>

<p>
We are entering now upon a thousand years of warfare between
the once quite separated civilizations of Mesopotamia and the
Nile.  At first Egypt was ascendant.  The great dynasties,
the Seventeenth Dynasty, which included Thothmes III and
Amenophis III and IV and a great queen Hatasu, and the
Nineteenth, when Rameses II, supposed by some to have been
the Pharaoh of Moses, reigned for sixty-seven years, raised
Egypt to high levels of prosperity.  In between there were
phases of depression for Egypt, conquest by the Syrians and
later conquest by the Ethiopians from the South.  In
Mesopotamia Babylon ruled, then the Hittites and the Syrians
of Damascus rose to a transitory predominance; at one time
the Syrians conquered Egypt; the fortunes of the Assyrians of
Nineveh ebbed and flowed; sometimes the city was a conquered
city; sometimes the Assyrians ruled in Babylon and assailed
Egypt.  Our space is too limited here to tell of the comings
and goings of the armies of the Egyptians and of the various
Semitic powers of Asia Minor, Syria and Mesopotamia.  They
were armies now provided with vast droves of war chariots,
for the horse&#8212;still used only for <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P97"></a>97}</span>war and
glory&#8212;had spread by this time into the old
civilizations from Central Asia.

Great conquerors appear in the dim light of that distant time
and pass, Tushratta, King of Mitanni, who captured Nineveh,
Tiglath Pileser I of Assyria who conquered Babylon.  At last
the Assyrians became the greatest military power of the time.
  Tiglath Pileser III conquered Babylon in 745
 <small>B.C.</small> and founded what historians call the New
Assyrian Empire.  Iron had also come now into civilization
out of the north; the Hittites, the precursors of the
Armenians, had it first and communicated its use to the
Assyrians, and an Assyrian usurper, Sargon II, armed his
troops with it.  Assyria became the first power to expound
the doctrine of blood and iron.  Sargon&rsquo;s son
Sennacherib led an army to the borders of Egypt, and was
defeated not by military strength but by the plague.
  Sennacherib&rsquo;s grandson Assurbanipal (who is also known
in history <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P98"></a>98}</span>by his Greek name of Sardanapalus)
did actually conquer Egypt in 670
 <small>B.C.</small>  But Egypt was already a conquered country
then under an Ethiopian dynasty.  Sardanapalus simply
replaced one conqueror by another.

If one had a series of political maps of this long period of
history, this interval of ten centuries, we should have Egypt
expanding and contracting like an am&#339;ba under a
microscope, and we should see these various Semitic states of
the Babylonians, the Assyrians, the Hittites and the Syrians
coming and going, eating each other up and disgorging each
other again.  To the west of Asia Minor there would be little
&#198;gean states like Lydia, whose capital was Sardis, and
Caria.  But after about 1200 <small>B.C.</small> and
perhaps earlier, a new set of names would come into the map
of the ancient world from <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P100"></a>100}</span>the north-east and from the north-
west.  These would be the names of certain barbaric tribes,
armed with iron weapons and using horse-chariots, who were
becoming a great affliction to the &#198;gean and Semitic
civilizations on the northern borders.  They all spoke
variants of what once must have been the same language,
Aryan.

<p>
Round the north-east of the Black and Caspian Seas were
coming the Medes and Persians.  Confused with these in the
records of the time were Scythians and Samatians.  From
north-east or north-west came the Armenians, from the north-
west of the sea-barrier through the Balkan peninsula came
Cimmerians, Phrygians and the Hellenic tribes whom now we
call the Greeks.  They were raiders and robbers and
plunderers of cities, these Ayrans, east and west alike.
  They were all kindred and similar peoples, hardy herdsmen who
had taken to plunder.  In the east they were still only
borderers and raiders, but in the west they were taking
cities and driving out the civilized &#198;gean populations.
  The &#198;gean peoples were so pressed that they were seeking
new homes in lands beyond the Aryan range.  Some were seeking
a settlement in the delta of the Nile and being repulsed by
the Egyptians; some, the Etruscans, seem to have sailed from
Asia Minor to found a state in the forest wildernesses of
middle Italy; some built themselves cities upon the south-
east coasts of the Mediterranean and became later that people
known in history as the Philistines.
</p>

<p>
Of these Aryans who came thus rudely upon the scene of the
ancient civilizations we will tell more fully in a later
section.  Here we note simply all this stir and emigration
amidst the area of the ancient civilizations, that was set up
by the swirl of the gradual and continuous advance of these
Aryan barbarians out of the northern forests and wildernesses
between 1600 and 600 <small>B.C.</small>
</p>

<p>
And in a section to follow we must tell also of a little
Semitic people, the Hebrews, in the hills behind the
Ph&#339;nician and Philistine coasts, who began to be of
significance in the world towards the end of this period.
  They produced a literature of very great importance in
subsequent history, a collection of books, histories, poems,
books of wisdom and prophetic works, the Hebrew Bible.
</p>

<p>
In Mesopotamia and Egypt the coming of the Aryans did not
cause fundamental changes until after 600
 <small>B.C.</small>  The flight of the <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P101"></a>101}</span>&#198;geans before the Greeks and
even the destruction of Cnossos must have seemed a very
remote disturbance to both the citizens of Egypt and of
Babylon.  Dynasties came and went in these cradle states of
civilization, but the main tenor of human life went on, with
a slow increase in refinement and complexity age by age.  In
Egypt the accumulated monuments of more ancient
times&#8212;the pyramids were already in their third thousand
of years and a show for visitors just as they are to-
day&#8212;were supplemented by fresh and splendid buildings,
more particularly in the time of the seventeenth and
nineteenth dynasties.  The great temples at Karnak and Luxor
date from this time.  All the chief monuments of Nineveh, the
great temples, the winged bulls with human heads, the reliefs
of kings and chariots and lion hunts, were done in these
centuries between 1600 and 600 <small>B.C.</small>,
and this period also covers most of the splendours of
Babylon.

<p>
Both from Mesopotamia and Egypt we now have abundant public
records, business accounts, stories, poetry and private
correspondence.  We know that life, for prosperous and
influential people in such cities as Babylon and the Egyptian
Thebes, was already almost as refined and as luxurious as
that of comfortable and prosperous people to-day.  Such
people lived an orderly and ceremonious life in beautiful and
beautifully furnished and decorated houses, wore richly
decorated clothing and lovely jewels; they had feasts and
festivals, entertained one another with music and dancing,
were waited upon by highly trained servants, were cared for
by doctors and dentists.  They did not travel very much or
very far, but boating <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P102"></a>102}</span>excursions were a common summer
pleasure both on the Nile and on the Euphrates.  The beast of
burthen was the ass; the horse was still used only in
chariots for war and upon occasions of state.  The mule was
still novel and the camel, though it was known in
Mesopotamia, had not been brought into Egypt.  And there were
few utensils of iron; copper and bronze remained the
prevailing metals.  Fine linen and cotton fabrics were known
as well as wool.  But there was no silk yet.  Glass was known
and beautifully coloured, but glass things were usually
small.  There was no clear glass and no optical use of glass.
  People had gold stoppings in their teeth but no spectacles on
their noses.
</p>

<p>
One odd contrast between the life of old Thebes or Babylon
and modern life was the absence of coined money.  Most trade
was still done by barter.  Babylon was financially far ahead
of Egypt.  Gold and silver were used for exchange and kept in
ingots; and there were bankers, before coinage, who stamped
their names and the weight on these lumps of precious metal.
  A merchant or traveller would carry precious stones to sell
to pay for his necessities.  Most servants and workers were
slaves who were paid not money but in kind.  As money came in
slavery declined.
</p>

<p>
A modern visitor to these crowning cities of the ancient
world would have missed two very important articles of diet;
there were no hens and no eggs.  A French cook would have
found small joy in Babylon.  These things came from the East
somewhere about the time of the last Assyrian empire.
</p>

<p>
Religion like everything else had undergone great refinement.
Human sacrifice for instance had long since disappeared;
animals or bread dummies had been substituted for the victim.
  (But the Ph&#339;nicians and especially the citizens of
Carthage, their greatest settlement in Africa, were accused,
later of immolating human beings.)  When a great chief had
died in the ancient days it had been customary to sacrifice
his wives and slaves and break spear and bow at his tomb so
that he should not go unattended and unarmed in the spirit
world.  In Egypt there survived of this dark tradition the
pleasant custom of burying small models of house and shop and
servants and cattle with the dead, models that give us to-day
the liveliest realization of the safe and cultivated life of
these ancient people, three thousand years and more ago.

Such was the ancient world before the coming of the Aryans out of
 the northern forests and plains.  In India and China there were
parallel developments.  In the great valleys of both these
regions agricultural city states of brownish peoples were
growing up, but in India they do not seem to have advanced or
coalesced so rapidly as the city states of Mesopotamia or
Egypt.  They were nearer the level of the ancient Sumerians
or of the Maya civilization of America.  Chinese history has
still to be modernized by Chinese scholars and cleared of
much legendary matter.  Probably China at this time was in
advance of India.  Contemporary with the seventeenth dynasty
in Egypt, there was a dynasty of emperors in China, the Shang
dynasty, priest emperors over a loose-knit empire of
subordinate kings.  The chief duty of these early emperors
was to perform the seasonal sacrifices.  Beautiful bronze
vessels from the time of the Shang dynasty still exist, and
their beauty and workmanship compel us to recognize that many
centuries of civilization must have preceded their
manufacture.

<h4 align="center">THE PRIMITIVE ARYANS</h4>

<p>

FOUR thousand years ago, that is to say about 2000
 <small>B.C.</small>, central and south-eastern Europe and
central Asia were probably warmer, moister and better wooded
than they are now.  In these regions of the earth wandered a
group of tribes mainly of the fair and blue-eyed Nordic race,
sufficiently in touch with one another to speak merely
variations of one common language from the Rhine to the
Caspian Sea.  At that time they may not have been a very
numerous people, and their existence was unsuspected by the
Babylonians to whom Hammurabi was giving laws, or by the
already ancient and cultivated land of Egypt which was
tasting in those days for the first time the bitterness of
foreign conquest.
</p>

<p>
These Nordic people were destined to play a very important
part indeed in the world&rsquo;s history.  They were a people
of the parklands and the forest clearings; they had no horses
at first but they had cattle; when they wandered they put
their tents and other gear on rough ox waggons; when they
settled for a time they may have made huts of wattle and mud.
  They burnt their important dead; they did not bury them
ceremoniously as the brunette peoples did.  They put the
ashes of their greater leaders in urns and then made a great
circular mound about them.  These mounds are the &ldquo;round
barrows&rdquo; that occur all over north Europe.  The
brunette people, their predecessors, did not burn their dead
but buried them in a sitting position in elongated mounds;
the &ldquo;long barrows.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Aryans raised crops of wheat, ploughing with oxen, but
they did not settle down by their crops; they would reap and
move on.  They had bronze, and somewhen about 1500
 <small>B.C.</small> they acquired iron.  They may have been the
discoverers of iron smelting.  And somewhen vaguely about
that time they also got the horse&#8212;which to begin with
they used only for draught purposes.  Their social life did
not centre upon a temple like that of the more settled people
round the Mediterranean, and their chief men were leaders
rather than priests.  They had an aristocratic social order
rather than a <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P106"></a>106}</span>divine and regal order; from a
very early stage they distinguished certain families as
leaderly and noble.

<p>
They were a very vocal people.  They enlivened their
wanderings by feasts, at which there was much drunkenness and
at which a special sort of man, the bards, would sing and
recite.  They had no writing until they had come into contact
with civilization, and the memories of these bards were their
living literature.  This use of recited language as an
entertainment did much to make it a fine and beautiful
instrument of expression, and to that no doubt the subsequent
predominance of the languages derived from Aryan is, in part,
to be ascribed.  Every Aryan people had its legendary history
crystallized in bardic recitations, epics, sagas and vedas,
as they were variously called.
</p>

<p>
The social life of these people centred about the households
of their leading men.  The hall of the chief where they
settled for a time was often a very capacious timber
building.  There were no doubt huts for herds and outlying
farm buildings; but with most of the Aryan peoples this hall
was the general centre, everyone went there to feast and hear
the bards and take part in games and discussions.  Cowsheds
and stabling surrounded it.  The chief and his wife and so
forth would sleep on a dais or in an upper gallery; the
commoner sort slept about anywhere, as people still do in
Indian households.  Except for weapons, ornaments, tools and
suchlike personal possessions there was a sort of patriarchal
communism in the tribe.  The chief owned the cattle and
grazing lands in the common interest; forest and rivers were
the wild.
</p>

<p>
This was the fashion of the people who were increasing and
multiplying over the great spaces of central Europe and west
central Asia during the growth of the great civilization of
Mesopotamia and the Nile, and whom we find pressing upon the
heliolithic peoples everywhere in the second millennium
before Christ.  They were coming into France and Britain and
into Spain.  They pushed westward in two waves.  The first of
these people who reached Britain and Ireland were armed with
bronze weapons.  They exterminated or subjugated the people
who had made the great stone monuments of Carnac in Brittany
and Stonehenge and Avebury in England.  They reached Ireland.
  They are called the Goidelic Celts. The <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P107"></a>107}</span>second wave of
a closely kindred people, perhaps intermixed with other
racial elements, brought iron with it into Great Britain, and
is known as the wave of Brythonic Celts.  From them the Welsh
derive their language.

<p>
Kindred Celtic peoples were pressing southward into Spain and
coming into contact not only with the heliolithic Basque
people who still occupied the country but with the Semitic
Ph&#339;nician colonies of the sea coast.  A closely allied
series of tribes, the Italians, were making their way down
the still wild and wooded Italian peninsula.  They did not
always conquer.  In the eighth century
 <small>B.C.</small>  Rome appears in history, a trading town on
the Tiber, inhabited by Aryan Latins but under the rule of
Etruscan nobles and kings.
</p>

<p>
At the other extremity of the Aryan range there was a similar
progress southward of similar tribes.  Aryan peoples,
speaking Sanskrit, had come down through the western passes
into North <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P108"></a>108}</span>India long before 1000
 <small>B.C.</small>  There they came into contact with a
primordial brunette civilization, the Dravidian civilization,
and learnt much from it.  Other Aryan tribes seem to have
spread over the mountain masses of Central Asia far to the
east of the present range of such peoples.  In Eastern
Turkestan there are still fair, blue-eyed Nordic tribes, but
now they speak Mongolian tongues.
</p>

<p>
Between the Black and Caspian Seas the ancient Hittites had
been submerged and &ldquo;Aryanized&rdquo; by the Armenians
before 1000 <small>B.C.</small>, and the Assyrians
and Babylonians were already aware of a new and formidable
fighting barbarism on the north-eastern frontiers, a group of
tribes amidst which the Scythians, the Medes and the Persians
remain as outstanding names.
</p>

<p>
But it was through the Balkan peninsula that Aryan tribes
made their first heavy thrust into the heart of the old-world
civilization.  They were already coming southward and
crossing into Asia Minor many centuries before 1000
 <small>B.C.</small>  First came a group of tribes of whom
the Phrygians were the most conspicuous, and then in
succession the &#198;olic, the Ionic and the Dorian Greeks.
  By 1000 <small>B.C.</small> they had wiped out the
ancient &#198;gean civilization both in the mainland of
Greece and in most of the Greek islands; the cities of
Mycen&#230; and Tiryns were obliterated and Cnossos was
nearly forgotten.  The Greeks had taken to the sea before
1000 <small>A.D.</small>, they had settled in Crete
and Rhodes, and they were founding colonies in Sicily and the
south of Italy after the fashion of the Ph&#339;nician
trading cities that were dotted along the Mediterranean
coasts.
</p>

<p>
So it was, while Tiglath Pileser III and Sargon II and
Sardanapalus were ruling in Assyria and fighting with
Babylonia and Syria and Egypt, the Aryan peoples were
learning the methods of civilization and making it over for
their own purposes in Italy and Greece and north Persia.  The
theme of history from the ninth century <small>B.C.</small>
<small>A.D.</small> onward for six centuries is the story of how
these Aryan peoples grew to power and enterprise and how at
last they subjugated the whole Ancient World, Semitic,
&#198;gean and Egyptian alike.  In form the Aryan peoples
were altogether victorious; but the struggle of Aryan,
Semitic and Egyptian ideas and methods was continued long
after the sceptre was in Aryan hands.  It is indeed a
struggle that goes on through all the rest of history and
still in a manner continues to this day.

<h4 align="center">THE LAST BABYLONIAN EMPIRE AND THE EMPIRE
OF DARIUS I</h4>

<p>

WE have already mentioned how Assyria became a great military
power under Tiglath Pileser III and under the usurper Sargon
II.  Sargon was not this man&rsquo;s original name; he
adopted it to flatter the conquered Babylonians by reminding
them of that ancient founder of the Akkadian Empire, Sargon
I, two thousand years before his time.  Babylon, for all that
it was a conquered city, was of greater population and
importance than Nineveh, and its great god Bel Marduk and its
traders and priests had to be treated politely.  In
Mesopotamia in the eighth century <small>B.C.</small>
<small>A.D.</small> we are already far beyond the barbaric days
when the capture of a town meant loot and massacre.
  Conquerors sought to propitiate and win the conquered.  For a
century and a half after Sargon the new Assyrian empire
endured and, as we have noted, Assurbanipal (Sardanapalus)
held at least lower Egypt.
</p>

<p>
But the power and solidarity of Assyria waned rapidly.  Egypt
by an effort threw off the foreigner under a Pharoah
Psammetichus I, and under Necho II attempted a war of
conquest in Syria.  By that time Assyria was grappling with
foes nearer at hand, and could make but a poor resistance.  A
Semitic people from south-east Mesopotamia, the Chaldeans,
combined with Aryan Medes and Persians from the north-east
against Nineveh, and in 606 <small>B.C.</small>&#8212;for now we
 are coming down to exact chronology&#8212;took that city.
</p>

<p>
There was a division of the spoils of Assyria.  A Median
Empire was set up in the north under Cyaxares.   It included
Nineveh, and its capital was Ecbatana.  Eastward it reached
to the borders of India.  To the south of this in a great
crescent was a new Chaldean Empire, the Second Babylonian
Empire, which rose to a very great degree of wealth and power
under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar the Great (the
Nebuchadnezzar of the Bible). The last great days, the <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P110"></a>110}</span>greatest days
of all, for Babylon began.  For a time the two Empires
remained at peace, and the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar was
married to Cyaxares.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Necho II was pursuing his easy conquests in Syria.
  He had defeated and slain King Josiah of Judah, a small
country of which there is more to tell presently, at the
battle of Megiddo in 608 <small>B.C.</small>, and he
pushed on to the Euphrates to encounter not a decadent
Assyria but a renascent Babylonia.  The Chaldeans dealt very
vigorously with the Egyptians.  Necho was routed and driven
back to Egypt, and the Babylonian frontier pushed down to the
ancient Egyptian boundaries.

<p>
From 606 until 589 <small>B.C.</small> the Second
Babylonian Empire flourished insecurely.  It flourished so
long as it kept the peace with the stronger, hardier Median
Empire to the north.  And during these sixty-seven years not
only life but learning flourished in the ancient city.

<p>
Even under the Assyrian monarchs and especially under
Sardanapalus, Babylon had been a scene of great intellectual
activity.  <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P111"></a>111}</span>Sardanapalus, though an Assyrian,
had been quite Babylon-ized.  He made a library, a library
not of paper but of the clay tablets that were used for
writing in Mesopotamia since early Sumerian days.  His
collection has been unearthed and is perhaps the most
precious store of historical material in the world.  The last
of the Chaldean line of Babylonian monarchs, Nabonidus, had
even keener literary tastes.  He patronized antiquarian
researches, and when a date was worked out by his
investigators for the accession of Sargon I he commemorated
the fact by inscriptions.  But there were many signs of
disunion in his empire, and he sought to centralize it by
bringing a number of the various local gods to Babylon and
setting up temples to them there.  This device was to be
practised quite successfully by the Romans in later times,
but in Babylon it roused the jealousy of the powerful
priesthood of Bel Marduk, the dominant god of the
Babylonians.  They cast about for a possible alternative to
Nabonidus and found it in Cyrus the Persian, the ruler of the
adjacent Median Empire.  Cyrus had already distinguished
himself by conquering Croesus, the rich king of Lydia in
Eastern Asia Minor.  <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P112"></a>112}</span>He came up against Babylon, there
was a battle outside the walls, and the gates of the city
were opened to him (538 <small>B.C.</small>).  His
soldiers entered the city without fighting.  The crown prince
Belshazzar, the son of Nabonidus, was feasting, the Bible
relates, when a hand appeared and wrote in letters of fire
upon the wall these mystical words:  <i>&ldquo;Mene, Mene,
Tekel, Upharsin,&rdquo;</i> which was interpreted by the
prophet Daniel, whom he summoned to read the riddle, as
&ldquo;God has numbered thy kingdom and finished it; thou art
weighed in the balance and found wanting and thy kingdom is
given to the Medes and Persians.&rdquo;  Possibly the priests
of Bel Marduk knew something about that writing on the wall.
  Belshazzar was killed that night, says the Bible.  Nabonidus
was taken prisoner, and the occupation of the city was so
peaceful that the services of Bel Marduk continued without
intermission.

<p>
The Persian Empire of Darius I, the first of the new Aryan
empires in the seat of the old civilizations, was the
greatest empire the world had hitherto seen.  It included all
Asia Minor and Syria, all the old Assyrian and Babylonian
empires, Egypt, the Caucasus and Caspian regions, Media,
Persia, and it extended into India as far as the Indus.  Such
an empire was possible because the horse and rider and the
chariot and the made-road had now been brought into the
world.  Hitherto the ass and ox and the camel for desert use
had afforded the swiftest method of <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P114"></a>114}</span>transport.  Great arterial roads
were made by the Persian rulers to hold their new empire, and
post horses were always in waiting for the imperial messenger
or the traveller with an official permit.  Moreover the world
was now beginning to use coined money, which greatly
facilitated trade and intercourse.  But the capital of this
vast empire was no longer Babylon.  In the long run the
priesthood of Bel Marduk gained nothing by their treason.
  Babylon though still important was now a declining city, and
the great cities of the new empire were Persepolis and Susa
and Ecbatana.  The capital was Susa.  Nineveh was already
abandoned and sinking into ruins.

name="chapXXI"></a><h3 align="center">XXI</h3>

<h4 align="center">THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE JEWS</h4>

<p>

AND now we can tell of the Hebrews, a Semitic people, not so
important in their own time as in their influence upon the
later history of the world.  They were settled in Judea long
before 1000 <small>B.C.</small>, and their capital
city after that time was Jerusalem.  Their story is
interwoven with that of the great empires on either side of
them, Egypt to the south and the changing empires of Syria,
Assyria and Babylon to the north.  Their country was an
inevitable high road between these latter powers and Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Their importance in the world is due to the fact that they
produced a written literature, a world history, a collection
of laws, chronicles, psalms, books of wisdom, poetry and
fiction and political utterances which became at last what
Christians know as the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible.  This
literature appears in history in the fourth or fifth century
<small>B.C.</small>
</p>

<p>
Probably this literature was first put together in Babylon.
  We have already told how the Pharaoh, Necho II, invaded the
Assyrian Empire while Assyria was fighting for life against
Medes, Persians and Chaldeans.  Josiah King of Judah opposed
him, and was defeated and slain at Megiddo (608
 <small>B.C.</small>).  Judah became a tributary to Egypt, and
when Nebuchadnezzar the Great, the new Chaldean king in
Babylon, rolled back Necho into Egypt, he attempted to manage
Judah by setting up puppet kings in Jerusalem.  The
experiment failed, the people massacred his Babylonian
officials, and he then determined to break up this little
state altogether, which had long been playing off Egypt
against the northern empire.  Jerusalem was sacked and burnt,
and the remnant of the people was carried off captive to
Babylon.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P116"></a>116}</span>There
they remained until Cyrus took Babylon (538
 <small>B.C.</small>).  He then collected them together and sent
them back to resettle their country and rebuild the walls and
temple of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
Before that time the Jews do not seem to have been a very
civilized or united people.  Probably only a very few of them
could read or write.  In their own history one never hears of
the early books of the Bible being read; the first mention of
a book is in the time of Josiah.  The Babylonian captivity
civilized them and consolidated them.  They returned aware of
their own literature, an acutely self-conscious and political
people.
</p>

<p>
Their Bible at that time seems to have consisted only of the
Pentateuch, that is to say the first five books of the Old
Testament as we know it.  In addition, as separate books they
already had many of the other books that have since been
incorporated with the Pentateuch into the present Hebrew
Bible, Chronicles, the Psalms and Proverbs for example.
</p>

<p>
The accounts of the Creation of the World, of Adam and Eve
and of the Flood, with which the Bible begins, run closely
parallel with similar Babylonian legends; they seem to have
been part of the common beliefs of all the Semitic peoples.
  So too the stories of Moses and of Samson have Sumerian and
Babylonian parallels.  But with the story of Abraham and
onward begins something more special to the Jewish race.
</p>

<p>
Abraham may have lived as early as the days of Hammurabi in
Babylon.  He was a patriarchal Semitic nomad.  To the book of
Genesis the reader must go for the story of his wanderings
and for the stories of his sons and grandchildren and how
they became captive in the Land of Egypt.  He travelled
through Canaan, and the God of Abraham, says the Bible story,
promised this smiling land of prosperous cities to him and to
his children.
</p>

<p>
And after a long sojourn in Egypt and after fifty years of
wandering in the wilderness under the leadership of Moses,
the children of Abraham, grown now to a host of twelve
tribes, invaded the land of Canaan from the Arabian deserts
to the East.  They may have done this somewhen between 1600
<small>B.C.</small> and 1300 <small>B.C.</small>;
 there are no Egyptian records of Moses nor
of Canaan at this time to help out the story.  But at any
rate they did not succeed in conquering any <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P117"></a>117}</span>more than the
hilly backgrounds of the promised land.  The coast was now in
the hands, not of the Canaanites but of newcomers, those
&#198;gean peoples, the Philistines; and their cities, Gaza,
Gath, Ashdod, Ascalon and Joppa successfully withstood the
Hebrew attack.  For many generations the children of Abraham
remained an obscure people of the hilly back country engaged
in incessant bickerings with the Philistines and with the
kindred tribes about them, the Moabites, the Midianites and
so forth.  The reader will find in the book of Judges a
record of their struggles and disasters during this period.
  For very largely it is a record of disasters and failures
frankly told.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P118"></a>118}</span>For most
of this period the Hebrews were ruled, so far as there was
any rule among them, by priestly judges selected by the
elders of the people, but at last somewhen towards 1000
<small>B.C.</small> they chose themselves a king, Saul, to
lead them in battle.  But Saul&rsquo;s leading was no great
improvement upon the leading of the Judges; he perished under
the hail of Philistine arrows at the battle of Mount Gilboa,
his armour went into the temple of the Philistine Venus, and
his body was nailed to the walls of Beth-shan.

<p>
His successor David was more successful and more politic.
  With David dawned the only period of prosperity the Hebrew
peoples were ever to know.  It was based on a close alliance
with the Ph&#339;nician city of Tyre, whose King Hiram seems
to have been a man of very great intelligence and enterprise.
  He wished to secure a trade route to the Red Sea through the
Hebrew hill country.  Normally Ph&#339;nician trade went to
the Red Sea by Egypt, but Egypt was in a state of profound
disorder at this <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P119"></a>119}</span>time; there may have been other
obstructions to Ph&#339;nician trade along this line, and at
any rate Hiram established the very closest relations both
with David and with his son and successor Solomon.  Under
Hiram&rsquo;s auspices the walls, palace and temple of
Jerusalem arose, and in return Hiram built and launched his
ships on the Red Sea.  A very considerable trade passed
northward and southward through Jerusalem.  And Solomon
achieved a prosperity and magnificence unprecedented in the
experience of his people.  He was even given a daughter of
Pharaoh in marriage.
</p>

<p>
But it is well to keep the proportion of things in mind.  At
the climax of his glories Solomon was only a little
subordinate king in a little city.  His power was so
transitory that within a few years of his death, Shishak the
first Pharaoh of the twenty-second dynasty, had taken
Jerusalem and looted most of its splendours.  The account of
Solomon&rsquo;s magnificence given in the books of Kings and
Chronicles is questioned by many critics.  They say that it
was added to and exaggerated by the patriotic pride of later
writers.  But the Bible account read carefully is not so
overwhelming as it appears at the first reading.
  Solomon&rsquo;s temple, if one works out the measurements,
would go inside a small suburban church, and his fourteen
hundred chariots cease to impress us when we learn from an
Assyrian monument that his successor Ahab sent a contingent
of two thousand to the Assyrian army.  It is also plainly
manifest from the Bible narrative that Solomon spent himself
in display and overtaxed and overworked his people.  At his
death the northern part of his kingdom broke off from
Jerusalem and became the independent kingdom of Israel.
  Jerusalem remained the capital city of Judah.

<p>
The prosperity of the Hebrew people was short-lived.  Hiram
died, and the help of Tyre ceased to strengthen Jerusalem.
  Egypt grew strong again.  The history of the kings of Israel
and the kings of Judah becomes a history of two little states
ground between, first, Syria, then Assyria and then Babylon
to the north and Egypt to the south.  It is a tale of
disasters and of deliverances that only delayed disaster.  It
is a tale of barbaric kings ruling a barbaric people. In 721
<small>B.C.</small> the kingdom of Israel was swept
away into captivity by the Assyrians and its people utterly
lost to history.  Judah struggled <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P121"></a>121}</span>on until in 604 <small>B.C.</small>,
 as we have told, it shared the fate of
Israel.  There may be details open to criticism in the Bible
story of Hebrew history from the days of the Judges onward,
but on the whole it is evidently a true story which squares
with all that has been learnt in the excavation of Egypt and
Assyria and Babylon during the past century.
</p>

<p>
It was in Babylon that the Hebrew people got their history
together and evolved their tradition.  The people who came
back to Jerusalem at the command of Cyrus were a very
different people in spirit and knowledge from those who had
gone into captivity.  They had learnt civilization.  In the
development of their peculiar character a very great part was
played by certain men, a new sort of men, the Prophets, to
whom we must now direct our attention.  These Prophets mark
the appearance of new and remarkable forces in the steady
development of human society.

<h4 align="center">PRIESTS AND PROPHETS IN JUDEA</h4>

<p>

THE fall of Assyria and Babylon were only the first of a
series of disasters that were to happen to the Semitic
peoples.  In the seventh century <small>B.C.</small>
it would have seemed as though the whole civilized world was
to be dominated by Semitic rulers.  They ruled the great
Assyrian empire and they had conquered Egypt; Assyria,
Babylon, Syria were all Semitic, speaking languages that were
mutually intelligible.  The trade of the world was in Semitic
hands.  Tyre, Sidon, the great mother cities of the
Ph&#339;nician coast, had thrown out colonies that grew at
last to even greater proportion in Spain, Sicily and Africa.
  Carthage, founded before 800 <small>B.C.</small>,
had risen to a population of more than a million.  It was for
a time the greatest city on earth.  Its ships went to Britain
and out into the Atlantic.  They may have reached Madeira.
  We have already noted how Hiram co-operated with Solomon to
build ships on the Red Sea for the Arabian and perhaps for
the Indian trade.  In the time of the Pharaoh Necho, a
Ph&#339;nician expedition sailed completely round Africa.
</p>

<p>
At that time the Aryan peoples were still barbarians.  Only
the Greeks were reconstructing a new civilization of the
ruins of the one they had destroyed, and the Medes were
becoming &ldquo;formidable,&rdquo; as an Assyrian inscription
calls them, in central Asia.  In 800
 <small>B.C.</small> no one could have prophesied that before the
third century <small>B.C.</small> every trace of
Semitic dominion would be wiped out by Aryan-speaking
conquerors, and that everywhere the Semitic peoples would be
subjects or tributaries or scattered altogether.  Everywhere
except in the northern deserts of Arabia, where the Bedouin
adhered steadily to the nomadic way of life, the ancient way
of life of the Semites before Sargon I and his Akkadians went
down to conquer Sumeria.  But the Arab Bedouin were never
conquered by Aryan masters.

<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P123"></a>123}</span>Now of
all these civilized Semites who were beaten and overrun in
these five eventful centuries one people only held together
and clung to its ancient traditions and that was this little
people, the Jews, who were sent back to build their city of
Jerusalem by Cyrus the Persian.  And they were able to do
this, because they had got together this literature of
theirs, their Bible, in Babylon.  It is not so much the Jews
who made the Bible as the Bible which made the Jews.  Running
through this Bible were certain ideas, different from the
ideas of the people about them, very stimulating and
sustaining ideas, to which they were destined to cling
through five and twenty centuries of hardship, adventure and
oppression.
</p>

<p>
Foremost of these Jewish ideas was this, that their God was
invisible and remote, an invisible God in a temple not made
with hands, a Lord of Righteousness throughout the earth.
  All other peoples had national gods embodied in images that
lived in temples.  If the image was smashed and the temple
razed, presently that god died out.  But this was a new idea,
this God of the Jews, in the heavens, high above priests and
sacrifices.  And this God of Abraham, the Jews believed, had
chosen them to be his peculiar people, to restore Jerusalem
and make it the capital of Righteousness in the World.  They
were a people exalted by their sense of a common destiny.
  This belief saturated them all when they returned to
Jerusalem after the captivity in Babylon.
</p>

<p>
Is it any miracle that in their days of overthrow and
subjugation many Babylonians and Syrians and so forth and
later on many Ph&#339;nicians, speaking practically the same
language and having endless customs, habits, tastes and
traditions in common, should be attracted by this inspiring
cult and should seek to share in its fellowship and its
promise?  After the fall of Tyre, Sidon, Carthage and the
Spanish Ph&#339;nician cities, the Ph&#339;nicians suddenly
vanish from history; and as suddenly we find, not simply in
Jerusalem but in Spain, Africa, Egypt, Arabia, the East,
wherever the Ph&#339;nicians had set their feet, communities
of Jews.  And they were all held together by the Bible and by
the reading of the Bible.  Jerusalem was from the first only
their nominal capital; their real city was this book of
books.  This is a new sort of thing in history.  It is
something of which the seeds were sown long before, when the
Sumerians <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P124"></a>124}</span>and Egyptians began to turn their
hieroglyphics into writing.  The Jews were a new thing, a
people without a king and presently without a temple (for as
we shall tell Jerusalem itself was broken up in 70
 <small>A.D.</small>), held together and consolidated out of
heterogeneous elements by nothing but the power of the
written word.
</p>

<p>
And this mental welding of the Jews was neither planned nor
foreseen nor done by either priests or statesmen.  Not only a
new kind of community but a new kind of man comes into
history with the development of the Jews.  In the days of
Solomon the Hebrews looked like becoming a little people just
like any other little people of that time clustering around
court and temple, ruled by the wisdom of the priest and led
by the ambition of the king.  But already, the reader may
learn from the Bible, this new sort of man of which we speak,
the Prophet, was in evidence.
</p>

<p>
As troubles thicken round the divided Hebrews the importance
of these Prophets increases.

What were these Prophets?  They were men of the most diverse
origins.  The Prophet Ezekiel was of the priestly caste and
the Prophet Amos wore the goatskin mantle of a shepherd, but
all had this in common, that they gave allegiance to no one
but to the God of Righteousness and that they spoke directly
to the people.  They <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P125"></a>125}</span>came without licence or
consecration.  &ldquo;Now the word of the Lord came unto
me;&rdquo; that was the formula.  They were intensely
political.  They exhorted the people against Egypt,
&ldquo;that broken reed,&rdquo; or against Assyria or
Babylon; they denounced the indolence of the priestly order
or the flagrant sins of the King.  Some of them turned their
attention to what we should now call &ldquo;social
reform.&rdquo;  The rich were &ldquo;grinding the faces of
the poor,&rdquo; the luxurious were consuming the
children&rsquo;s bread; wealthy people made friends with and
imitated the splendours and vices of foreigners; and this was
hateful to Jehovah, the God of Abraham, who would certainly
punish this land.

<p>
These fulminations were written down and preserved and
studied.  They went wherever the Jews went, and wherever they
went they spread a new religious spirit.  They carried the
common man past priest and temple, past court and king and
brought him face to face with the Rule of Righteousness.
  That is their supreme importance in the history of mankind.
  In the great utterances of Isaiah the prophetic voice rises
to a pitch of splendid anticipation and foreshadows the whole
earth united and at peace under one God.  Therein the Jewish
prophecies culminate.
</p>

<p>
All the Prophets did not speak in this fashion, and the
intelligent reader of the prophetic books will find much hate
in them, much prejudice, and much that will remind him of the
propaganda pamphlets <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P126"></a>126}</span>of the present time.  Nevertheless
it is the Hebrew Prophets of the period round and about the
Babylonian captivity who mark the appearance of a new power
in the world, the power of individual moral appeal, of an
appeal to the free conscience of mankind against the fetish
sacrifices and slavish loyalties that had hitherto bridled
and harnessed our race.

<h4 align="center">THE GREEKS</h4>

<p>

NOW while after Solomon (whose reign was probably about 960
<small>B.C.</small>) the divided kingdoms of Israel
and Judah were suffering destruction and deportation, and
while the Jewish people were developing their tradition in
captivity in Babylon, another great power over the human
mind, the Greek tradition, was also arising.  While the
Hebrew prophets were working out a new sense of direct moral
responsibility between the people and an eternal and
universal God of Right, the Greek philosophers were training
the human mind in a new method and spirit of intellectual
adventure.
</p>

<p>
The Greek tribes as we have told were a branch of the Aryan-
speaking stem. They had come down among the &#198;gean cities
and islands some centuries before 1000
 <small>B.C.</small>  They were probably already in southward
movement before the Pharaoh Thothmes hunted his first
elephants beyond the conquered Euphrates.  For in those days
there were elephants in Mesopotamia and lions in Greece.
</p>

<p>
It is possible that it was a Greek raid that burnt Cnossos,
but there are no Greek legends of such a victory though there
are stories of Minos and his palace (the Labyrinth) and of
the skill of the Cretan artificers.

<p>
Like most of the Aryans these Greeks had singers and reciters
whose performances were an important social link, and these
handed down from the barbaric beginnings of their people two
great epics, the <i>Iliad</i>, telling how a league of Greek
tribes besieged and took and sacked the town of Troy in Asia
Minor, and the <i>Odyssey</i>, being a long adventure story
of the return of the sage captain, Odysseus, from Troy to his
own island.  These epics were written down somewhen in the
eighth or seventh century <small>B.C.</small>, when
the Greeks had acquired the use of an alphabet from their
more civilized neighbours, but they <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P129"></a>129}</span>are supposed to have been in
existence very much earlier.  Formerly they were ascribed to
a particular blind bard, Homer, who was supposed to have sat
down and composed them as Milton composed Paradise Lost.
  Whether there really was such a poet, whether he composed or
only wrote down and polished these epics and so forth, is a
favourite quarrelling ground for the erudite.  We need not
concern ourselves with such bickerings here.  The thing that
matters from our point of view is that the Greeks were in
possession of their epics in the eighth century
 <small>B.C.</small>, and that they were a common possession and a
link between their various tribes, giving them a sense of
fellowship as against the outer barbarians.  They were a
group of kindred peoples linked by the spoken and afterwards
by the written word, and sharing common ideals of courage and
behaviour.
</p>

<p>
The epics showed the Greeks a barbaric people without iron,
without writing, and still not living in cities.  They seem
to have lived at first in open villages of huts around the
halls of their chiefs outside the ruins of the &#198;gean
cities they had destroyed.  Then they began to wall their
cities and to adopt the idea of temples from the people they
had conquered.  It has been said that the cities of the
primitive civilizations grew up about the altar of some
tribal god, and that the wall was added; in the cities of the
Greeks the wall preceded the temple.  They began to trade and
send out colonies.  By the seventh century
 <small>B.C.</small> a new series of cities had grown up in the
valleys and islands of Greece, forgetful of the &#198;gean
cities and civilization that had preceded them; Athens,
Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Samos, Miletus among the chief.
  There were already Greek settlements along the coast of the
Black Sea and in Italy and Sicily.  The heel and toe of Italy
was called Magna Gr&#230;cia.  Marseilles was a Greek town
established on the site of an earlier Ph&#339;nician colony.
</p>

<p>
Now countries which are great plains or which have as a chief
means of transport some great river like the Euphrates or
Nile tend to become united under some common rule.  The
cities of Egypt and the cities of Sumeria, for example, ran
together under one system of government. But the Greek
peoples were cut up among islands and mountain valleys; both
Greece and Magna Gr&#230;cia are very mountainous; and the
tendency was all the other way.  When the <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P130"></a>130}</span>Greeks come
into history they are divided up into a number of little
states which showed no signs of coalescence.  They are
different even in race.  Some consist chiefly of citizens of
this or that Greek tribe, Ionic, &#198;olian or Doric; some
have a mingled population of Greeks and descendants of the
pre-Greek &ldquo;Mediterranean&rdquo; folk; some have an
unmixed free citizenship of Greeks lording it over an
enslaved conquered population like the &ldquo;Helots&rdquo;
in Sparta.  In some the old leaderly Aryan families have
become a close aristocracy; in some there is a democracy of
all the Aryan citizens; in some there are elected or even
hereditary kings, in some usurpers or tyrants.

<p>
And the same geographical conditions that kept the Greek
states divided and various, kept them small.  The largest
states were smaller than many English counties, and it is
doubtful if the population of any of their cities ever
exceeded a third of a million.  Few came up even to 50,000.
  There were unions of interest and sympathy but no
coalescences.  Cities made leagues and alliances as <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P131"></a>131}</span>trade
increased, and small cities put themselves under the
protection of great ones.  Yet all Greece was held together
in a certain community of feeling by two things, by the epics
and by the custom of taking part every fourth year in the
athletic contests at Olympia.  This did not prevent wars and
feuds, but it mitigated something of the savagery of war
between them, and a truce protected all travellers to and
from the games.  As time went on the sentiment of a common
heritage grew and the number of states participating in the
Olympic games increased until at last not only Greeks but
competitors from the closely kindred countries of Epirus and
Macedonia to the north were admitted.
</p>

<p>
The Greek cities grew in trade and importance, and the
quality of their civilization rose steadily in the seventh
and sixth centuries <small>B.C.</small>  Their
social life differed in many interesting points from the
social life of the &#198;gean and river valley civilizations.
  They had splendid temples but the priesthood was not the
great traditional body it was in the cities of the older
world, the-repository of all knowledge, the storehouse of
ideas.  They had leaders and noble families, but no quasi-
divine monarch surrounded by an elaborately organized court.
  Rather their organization was aristocratic, with leading
families which kept each other in order.  Even their so-
called &ldquo;democracies&rdquo; were aristocratic; every
citizen had a share in public affairs and came to the
assembly in a democracy, <i>but everybody was not a
citizen</i>.  The Greek democracies were not like our modern
&ldquo;democracies&rdquo; in which everyone has a vote.  Many
of the Greek democracies had a few hundred or a few thousand
citizens and then many thousands of slaves, freedmen and so
forth, with no share in public affairs.  Generally in Greece
affairs were in the hands of a community of substantial men.
  Their kings and their tyrants alike were just men set in
front of other men or usurping a leadership; they were not
quasi-divine overmen like Pharaoh or Minos or the monarchs of
Mesopotamia.  Both thought and government therefore had a
freedom under Greek conditions such as they had known in none
of the older civilizations.  The Greeks had brought down into
cities the individualism, the personal initiative of the
wandering life of the northern parklands.  They were the
first republicans of importance in history.

<p>
And we find that as they emerge from a condition of barbaric warfare
a new thing becomes apparent in their intellectual life.  We
find men who are not priests seeking and recording knowledge
and enquiring into the mysteries of life and being, in a way
that has hitherto been the sublime privilege of priesthood or
the presumptuous amusement of kings.  We find already in the
sixth century <small>B.C.</small>&#8212;perhaps
while Isaiah was still prophesying in Babylon&#8212;such men
as Thales and Anaximander of Miletus and Heraclitus of
Ephesus, who were what we should now call independent
gentlemen, giving their minds to shrewd questionings of the
world in which we live, asking what its real nature was,
whence it came and what its destiny might be, and refusing
all ready-made or evasive answers.  Of these questionings of
the universe by the Greek mind, we shall have more to say a
little later in this history.  These Greek enquirers
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P133"></a>133}</span> who
begin to be remarkable in the sixth century
 <small>B.C.</small> are the first philosophers, the first
&ldquo;wisdom-lovers,&rdquo; in the world.
</p>

<p>
And it may be noted here how important a century this sixth
century <small>B.C.</small> was in the history of
humanity.  For not only were these Greek philosophers
beginning the research for clear ideas about this universe
and man&rsquo;s place in it and Isaiah carrying Jewish
prophecy to its sublimest levels, but as we shall tell later
Gautama Buddha was then teaching in India and Confucius and
Lao Tse in China.  From Athens to the Pacific the human mind
was astir.

<h4 align="center">THE WARS OF THE GREEKS AND PERSIANS</h4>

<p>

WHILE the Greeks in the cities in Greece, South Italy and
Asia Minor were embarking upon free intellectual enquiry and
while in Babylon and Jerusalem the last of the Hebrew
prophets were creating a free conscience for mankind, two
adventurous Aryan peoples, the Medes and the Persians, were
in possession of the civilization of the ancient world and
were making a great empire, the Persian empire, which was far
larger in extent than any empire the world had seen hitherto.
  Under Cyrus, Babylon and the rich and ancient civilization of
Lydia had been added to the Persian rule; the Ph&#339;nician
cities of the Levant and all the Greek cities in Asia Minor
had been made tributary, Cambyses had subjected Egypt, and
Darius I, the Mede, the third of the Persian rulers (521
<small>B.C.</small>), found himself monarch as it
seemed of all the world.  His couriers rode with his decrees
from the Dardanelles to the Indus and from Upper Egypt to
Central Asia.
</p>

<p>
The Greeks in Europe, it is true, Italy, Carthage, Sicily and
the Spanish Ph&#339;nician settlements, were not under the
Persian Peace; but they treated it with respect and the only
people who gave any serious trouble were the old parent
hordes of Nordic people in South Russia and Central Asia, the
Scythians, who raided the northern and north-eastern borders.
</p>

<p>
Of course the population of this great Persian empire was not
a population of Persians, The Persians were only the small
conquering minority of this enormous realm.  The rest of the
population was what it had been before the Persians came from
time immemorial, only that Persian was the administrative
language.  Trade and finance were still largely Semitic, Tyre
and Sidon as of old were the great Mediterranean ports and
Semitic shipping plied upon the seas.  But many of these
Semitic merchants and business people as <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P135"></a>135}</span>they went from
place to place already found a sympathetic and convenient
common history in the Hebrew tradition and the Hebrew
scriptures.  A new element which was increasing rapidly in
this empire was the Greek element.  The Greeks were becoming
serious rivals to the Semites upon the sea, and their
detached and vigorous intelligence made them useful and,
unprejudiced officials.

<p>
It was on account of the Scythians that Darius I invaded
Europe.  He wanted to reach South Russia, the homeland of the
Scythian horsemen.  He crossed the Bosphorus with a great
army and marched through Bulgaria to the Danube, crossed this
by a bridge of boats and pushed far northward.  His army
suffered terribly.  It was largely an infantry force and the
mounted Scythians rode all round it, cut off its supplies,
destroyed any stragglers and never came to a pitched battle.
  Darius was forced into an inglorious retreat.
</p>

<p>
He returned himself to Susa but he left an army in Thrace and
Macedonia, and Macedonia submitted to Darius.  Insurrections
of the Greek cities in Asia followed this failure, and the
European Greeks were drawn into the contest.  Darius resolved
upon the subjugation of the Greeks in Europe.  With the
Ph&#339;nician fleet at his disposal he was able to subdue
one island after another, and finally in 490
 <small>B.C.</small> he made his main attack upon Athens.  A
considerable Armada sailed from the ports of Asia Minor and
the eastern Mediterranean, and the expedition landed its
troops at Marathon to the north of Athens.  There they were
met and signally defeated by the Athenians.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P136"></a>136}</span>An
extraordinary thing happened at this time.  The bitterest
rival of Athens in Greece was Sparta, but now Athens appealed
to Sparta, sending a herald, a swift runner, imploring the
Spartans not to let Greeks become slaves to barbarians.  This
runner (the prototype of all &ldquo;Marathon&rdquo; runners)
did over a hundred miles of broken country in less than two
days.  The Spartans responded promptly and generously; but
when, in three days, the Spartan force reached Athens, there
was nothing for it to do but to view the battlefield and the
bodies of the defeated Persian soldiers.  The Persian fleet
had returned to Asia.  So ended the first Persian attack on
Greece.
</p>

<p>
The next was much more impressive.  Darius died soon after
the news of his defeat at Marathon reached him, and for four
years his son and successor, Xerxes, prepared a host to crush
the Greeks.  For a time terror united all the Greeks.  The
army of Xerxes was certainly the greatest that had hitherto
been assembled in the world.  It was a huge assembly of
discordant elements.  It crossed the Dardanelles, 480
 <small>B.C.</small>, by a bridge of boats; and along the
coast as it advanced moved an equally miscellaneous fleet
carrying supplies.  At the narrow pass of Thermopyl&#230; a
small force of 1400 men under the Spartan Leonidas resisted
this multitude, and after a fight of unsurpassed heroism was
completely destroyed.  Every man was killed.  But the losses
they inflicted upon the Persians were enormous, and the army
of Xerxes pushed on to Thebes and Athens in a chastened mood.
  Thebes surrendered and made terms.  The Athenians abandoned
their city and it was burnt.
</p>

<p>
Greece seemed in the hands of the conqueror, but again came
victory against the odds and all expectations.  The Greek
fleet, though not a third the size of the Persian, assailed
it in the bay of Salamis and destroyed it.  Xerxes found
himself and his immense army cut off from supplies and his
heart failed him.  He retreated to Asia with one half of his
army, leaving the rest to be defeated at Platea (479
 <small>B.C.</small>) what time the remnants of the Persian
fleet were hunted down by the Greeks and destroyed at
Mycal&#230; in Asia Minor.

The Persian danger was at an end.  Most of the Greek cities
in Asia became free.  All this is told in great detail and
with much picturesqueness in the first of written histories,
the <i>History</i> of <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P138"></a>138}</span>Herodotus.  This Herodotus was
born about 484 <small>B.C.</small> in the Ionian
city of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor, and he visited Babylon
and Egypt in his search for exact particulars.  From
Mycal&#230; onward Persia sank into a confusion of dynastic
troubles.  Xerxes was murdered in 465 <small>B.C.</small>
 and rebellions in Egypt, Syria and Media
broke up the brief order of that mighty realm.  The history
of Herodotus lays stress on the weakness of Persia.  This
history is indeed what we should now call
propaganda&#8212;propaganda for Greece to unite and conquer
Persia.  Herodotus makes one character, Aristagoras, go to
the Spartans with a map of the known world and say to them:
&ldquo;These Barbarians are not valiant in fight.  You on the
other hand have now attained the utmost skill in war .... No
other nations in the world have what they possess: gold,
silver, bronze, embroidered garments, beasts and slaves.
  <i>All this you might have for yourselves, if you so
desired</i>.&rdquo;

<h4 align="center">THE SPLENDOUR OF GREECE</h4>

<p>

THE century and a half that followed the defeat of Persia was
one of very great splendour for the Greek civilization.  True
that Greece was torn by a desperate struggle for ascendancy
between Athens, Sparta and other states (the Peloponnesian
War 431 to 404 <small>B.C.</small>) and that in 338
<small>B.C.</small> the Macedonians became virtually
masters of Greece; nevertheless during this period the
thought and the creative and artistic impulse of the Greeks
rose to levels that made their achievement a lamp to mankind
for all the rest of history.
</p>

<p>
The head and centre of this mental activity was Athens.  For
over thirty years (466 to 428 <small>B.C.</small>)
Athens was dominated by a man of great vigour and liberality
of mind, Pericles, who set himself to rebuild the city from
the ashes to which the Persians had reduced it. The beautiful
ruins that still glorify Athens to-day are chiefly the
remains of this great effort.  And he did not simply rebuild
a material Athens.  He rebuilt Athens intellectually.  He
gathered about him not only architects and sculptors but
poets, dramatists, philosophers and teachers.  Herodotus came
to Athens to recite his history (438 <small>B.C.</small>).
 Anaxagoras came with the beginnings of a
scientific description of the sun and stars.  &#198;schylus,
Sophocles and Euripides one after the other carried the Greek
drama to its highest levels or beauty and nobility.
</p>

<p>
The impetus Pericles gave to the intellectual life of Athens
lived on after his death, and in spite of the fact that the
peace of Greece was now broken by the Peloponnesian War and a
long and wasteful struggle for &ldquo;ascendancy&rdquo; was
beginning.  Indeed the darkling of the political horizon
seems for a time to have quickened rather than discouraged
men&rsquo;s minds.
</p>

<p>
Already long before the time of Pericles the peculiar freedom
of Greek institutions had given great importance to skill in
discussion.  <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P140"></a>140}</span>Decision rested neither with king
nor with priest but in the assemblies of the people or of
leading men.  Eloquence and able argument became very
desirable accomplishments therefore, and a class of teachers
arose, the Sophists, who undertook to strengthen young men in
these arts.  But one cannot reason without matter, and
knowledge followed in the wake of speech.  The activities and
rivalries of these Sophists led very naturally to an acute
examination of style, of methods of thought and of the
validity of arguments.  When Pericles died a certain Socrates
was becoming prominent as an able and destructive critic of
bad argument&#8212;and much of the teaching of the Sophists
was bad argument.  A group of brilliant young men gathered
about Socrates.  In the end Socrates was executed for
disturbing people&rsquo;s minds (399 <small>B.C.</small>),
 he was condemned after the dignified
fashion of the Athens of those days to drink in his own house
and among his own friends a poisonous draught made from
hemlock, but the disturbance of people&rsquo;s minds went on
in spite of his condemnation. His young men carried on his
teaching.

Chief among these young men was Plato (427 to 347
 <small>B.C.</small>) who presently began to teach philosophy in
the grove of the Academy.  His teaching fell into two main
divisions, an examination of the foundations and methods of
human thinking and an examination of political institutions.
  He was the first man to write a Utopia, that is to say the
plan of a community different from and better than any <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P142"></a>142}</span>existing
community.  This shows an altogether unprecedented boldness
in the human mind which had hitherto accepted social
traditions and usages with scarcely a question.  Plato said
plainly to mankind: &ldquo;Most of the social and political
ills from which you suffer are under your control, given only
the will and courage to change them.  You can live in another
and a wiser fashion if you choose to think it out and work it
out.  You are not awake to your own power.&rdquo;  That is a
high adventurous teaching that has still to soak in to the
common intelligence of our race.  One of his earliest works
was the Republic, a dream of a communist aristocracy; his
last unfinished work was the Laws, a scheme of regulation for
another such Utopian state.

The criticism of methods of thinking and methods of
government was carried on after Plato&rsquo;s death by
Aristotle, who had been his pupil and who taught in the
Lyceum.  Aristotle came from the city of Stagira in
Macedonia, and his father was court physician to the
Macedonian king.  For a time Aristotle was tutor to
Alexander, <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P144"></a>144}</span>the king&rsquo;s son, who was
destined to achieve very great things of which we shall soon
be telling.  Aristotle&rsquo;s work upon methods of thinking
carried the science of Logic to a level at which it remained
for fifteen hundred years or more, until the medi&#230;val
schoolmen took up the ancient questions again.  He made no
Utopias.  Before man could really control his destiny as
Plato taught, Aristotle perceived that he needed far more
knowledge and far more accurate knowledge than he possessed.
  And so Aristotle began that systematic collection of
knowledge which nowadays we call Science.  He sent out
explorers to collect <i>facts</i>.  He was the father of
natural history.  He was the founder of political science.
  His students at the Lyceum examined and compared the
constitutions of 158 different states ....
</p>

<p>
Here in the fourth century <small>B.C.</small> we
find men who are practically &ldquo;modern thinkers.&rdquo;
The child-like, dream-like methods of primitive thought had
given way to a disciplined and critical attack upon the
problems of life.  The weird and monstrous symbolism and
imagery of the gods and god monsters, and all the taboos and
awes and restraints that have hitherto encumbered thinking
are here completely set aside.  Free, exact and systematic
thinking has begun.  The fresh and unencumbered mind of these
newcomers out of the northern forests has thrust itself into
the mysteries of the temple and let the daylight in.

<h4 align="center">THE EMPIRE OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT</h4>

<p>

FROM 431 to 404 <small>B.C.</small> the
Peloponnesian War wasted Greece.  Meanwhile to the north of
Greece, the kindred country of Macedonia was rising slowly to
power and civilization.  The Macedonians spoke a language
closely akin to Greek, and on several occasions Macedonian
competitors had taken part in the Olympic games.  In 359
<small>B.C.</small> a man of very great abilities
and ambition became king of this little country&#8212;Philip.
  Philip had previously been a hostage in Greece; he had had a
thoroughly Greek education and he was probably aware of the
ideas of Herodotus&#8212;which had also been developed by the
philosopher Isocrates&#8212;of a possible conquest of Asia by
a consolidated Greece.
</p>

<p>
He set himself first to extend and organize his own realm and
to remodel his army.  For a thousand years now the charging
horse-chariot had been the decisive factor in battles, that
and the close-fighting infantry.  Mounted horsemen had also
fought, but as a cloud of skirmishers, individually and
without discipline.  Philip made his infantry fight in a
closely packed mass, the Macedonian phalanx, and he trained
his mounted gentlemen, the knights or companions, to fight in
formation and so invented cavalry.  The master move in most
of his battles and in the battles of his son Alexander was a
cavalry charge.  The phalanx <i>held</i> the enemy infantry
in front while the cavalry swept away the enemy horse on his
wings and poured in on the flank and rear of his infantry.
  Chariots were disabled by bowmen, who shot the horses.
</p>

<p>
With this new army Philip extended his frontiers through
Thessaly to Greece; and the battle of Ch&#230;ronia (338
<small>B.C.</small>), fought against Athens and her
allies, put all Greece at his feet.  At last the dream of
Herodotus was bearing fruit.  A congress of all the Greek
states appointed Philip captain-general of the Gr&#230;co-
Macedonian confederacy <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P146"></a>146}</span>against Persia, and in 336
 <small>B.C.</small> his advanced guard crossed into Asia
upon this long premeditated adventure.  But he never followed
it.  He was assassinated; it is believed at the instigation
of his queen Olympias, Alexander&rsquo;s mother.  She was
jealous because Philip had married a second wife.

<p>
But Philip had taken unusual pains with his son&rsquo;s
education.  He had not only secured Aristotle, the greatest
philosopher in the world, as this boy&rsquo;s tutor, but he
had shared his ideas with him and thrust military experience
upon him.  At Ch&#230;ronia Alexander, who was then only
eighteen years old, had been in command of the cavalry.  And
so it was possible for this young man, who was still only
twenty years old at the time of his accession, to take up his
father&rsquo;s task at once and to proceed successfully with
the Persian adventure.
</p>

<p>
In 334 <small>B.C.</small>&#8212;for two years were
needed to establish and confirm his position in Macedonia and
Greece&#8212;he crossed into Asia, defeated a not very much
bigger Persian army at the battle of the Granicus and
captured a number of cities in Asia Minor.  He kept along the
sea-coast.  It was necessary for him to reduce and garrison
all the coast towns as he advanced because the Persians had
control of the fleets of Tyre and Sidon and so had command of
the sea.  <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P147"></a>147}</span>Had he left a hostile port in his
rear the Persians might have landed forces to raid his
communications and cut him off. At  Issus (333 <small>B.C.</small>)
 he met and smashed a vast conglomerate host
under Darius III.  Like the host of Xerxes that had crossed
the Dardanelles a century and a half before, it was an
incoherent accumulation of contingents and it was encumbered
with a multitude of court officials, the harem of Darius and
many camp followers.  Sidon surrendered to Alexander but Tyre
resisted obstinately.  Finally that great city was stormed
and plundered and destroyed.  Gaza also was stormed, and
towards the end of 332 <small>B.C.</small> the
conqueror entered Egypt and took over its rule from the
Persians.

<p>
At Alexandretta and at Alexandria in Egypt he built great
cities, accessible from the land and so incapable of revolt.
  To these the trade of the Ph&#339;nician cities was diverted.
  The Ph&#339;nicians of the western Mediterranean suddenly
disappear from history&#8212;and as immediately the Jews of
Alexandria and the other new trading cities created by
Alexander appear.
</p>

<p>
In 331 <small>B.C.</small> Alexander marched out of
Egypt upon Babylon as Thothmes and Rameses and Necho had done
before him.  But he marched by way of Tyre.  At Arbela near
the ruins of Nineveh, <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P148"></a>148}</span>which was already a forgotten
city, he met Darius and fought the decisive battle of the
war.  The Persian chariot charge failed, a Macedonian cavalry
charge broke up the great composite host and the phalanx
completed the victory.  Darius led the retreat.  He made no
further attempt to resist the invader but fled northward into
the country of the Medes.  Alexander marched on to Babylon,
still prosperous and important, and then to Susa and
Persepolis.  There after a drunken festival he burnt down the
palace of Darius, the king of kings.

<p>
Thence Alexander presently made a military parade of central
Asia, going to the utmost bounds of the Persian empire.  At
first he turned northward.  Darius was pursued; and he was
overtaken at dawn dying in his chariot, having been murdered
by his own people.  He was still living when the foremost
Greeks reached him.  Alexander came up to find him dead.
  Alexander skirted the Caspian Sea, he went up into the
mountains of western Turkestan, he came down by Herat (which
he founded) and Cabul and the Khyber Pass into <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P149"></a>149}</span>India.  He
fought a great battle on the Indus with an Indian king,
Porus, and here the Macedonian troops met elephants for the
first time and defeated them.  Finally he built himself
ships, sailed down to the mouth of the Indus, and marched
back by the coast of Beluchistan, reaching Susa again in 324
<small>B.C.</small> after an absence of six years.
  He then prepared to consolidate and organize this vast empire
he had won.  He sought to win over his new subjects.  He
assumed the robes and tiara of a Persian monarch, and this
roused the jealousy of his Macedonian commanders.  He had
much trouble with them.  He arranged a number of marriages
between these Macedonian officers and Persian and Babylonian
women: the &ldquo;Marriage of the East and West.&rdquo;  He
never lived to effect the consolidation he had planned.  A
fever seized him after a drinking bout in Babylon and he died
in 323 <small>B.C.</small>
</p>

<p>
Immediately this vast dominion fell to pieces.  One of his
generals, Seleucus, retained most of the old Persian empire
from the Indus to Ephesus; another, Ptolemy, seized Egypt,
and Antigonus secured Macedonia.  The rest of the empire
remained unstable, passing under the control of a succession
of local adventurers.  Barbarian raids began from the north
and grew in scope and intensity.  Until at last, as we shall
tell, a new power, the power of the Roman republic, came out
of the west to subjugate one fragment after another and weld
them together into a new and more enduring empire.

<h4 align="center">THE MUSEUM AND LIBRARY AT ALEXANDRIA</h4>

<p>

BEFORE the time of Alexander Greeks had already been
spreading as merchants, artists, officials, mercenary
soldiers, over most of the Persian dominions.  In the
dynastic disputes that followed the death of Xerxes, a band
of ten thousand Greek mercenaries played a part under the
leadership of Xenophon.  Their return to Asiatic Greece from
Babylon is described in his <i>Retreat of the Ten
Thousand</i>, one of the first war stories that was ever
written by a general in command.  But the conquests of
Alexander and the division of his brief empire among his
subordinate generals, greatly stimulated this permeation of
the ancient world by the Greeks and their language and
fashions and culture.  Traces of this Greek dissemination are
to be found far away in central Asia and in north-west India.
  Their influence upon the development of Indian art was
profound.
</p>

<p>
For many centuries Athens retained her prestige as a centre
of art and culture; her schools went on indeed to 529
 <small>A.D.</small>, that is to say for nearly a thousand
years; but the leadership in the intellectual activity of the
world passed presently across the Mediterranean to
Alexandria, the new trading city that Alexander had founded.
  Here the Macedonian general Ptolemy had become Pharaoh, with
a court that spoke Greek.  He had become an intimate of
Alexander before he became king, and he was deeply saturated
with the ideas of Aristotle.  He set himself, with great
energy and capacity, to organize knowledge and investigation.
  He also wrote a history of Alexander&rsquo;s campaigns which,
unhappily, is lost to the world.
</p>

<p>
Alexander had already devoted considerable sums to finance
the enquiries of Aristotle, but Ptolemy I was the first
person to make a permanent endowment of science.  He set up a
foundation in Alexandria which was formerly dedicated to the
Muses, the Museum <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P151"></a>151}</span>of Alexandria.  For two or three
generations the scientific work done at Alexandria was
extraordinarily good.  Euclid, Eratosthenes who measured the
size of the earth and came within fifty miles of its true
diameter, Apollonius who wrote on conic sections, Hipparchus
who made the first star map and catalogue, and Hero who
devised the first steam engine are among the greater stars of
an extraordinary constellation of scientific pioneers.
  Archimedes came from Syracuse to Alexandria to study, and was
a frequent correspondent of the Museum.  Herophilus was one
of the greatest of Greek anatomists, and is said to have
practised vivisection.
</p>

<p>
For a generation or so during the reigns of Ptolemy I and
Ptolemy II there was such a blaze of knowledge and discovery
at Alexandria as the world was not to see again until the
sixteenth century <small>A.D.</small>  But it did
not continue.  There may have been several causes of this
decline.  Chief among them, the late Professor Mahaffy
suggested, was the fact that the Museum was a
&ldquo;royal&rdquo; college and all its professors and
fellows were appointed and paid by Pharaoh.  This was all
very well when Pharaoh was Ptolemy I, the pupil and friend of
Aristotle.  But as the dynasty of the Ptolemies went on they
became Egyptianized, they fell under the sway of Egyptian
priests and Egyptian religious developments, they ceased to
follow the work that was done, and their control stifled the
spirit of enquiry altogether.  The Museum produced little
good work after its first century of activity.
</p>

<p>
Ptolemy I not only sought in the most modern spirit to
organize the finding of fresh knowledge.  He tried also to
set up an encyclop&#230;dic storehouse of wisdom in the
Library of Alexandria.  It was not simply a storehouse, it
was also a book-copying and book-selling organization.  A
great army of copyists was set to work perpetually
multiplying copies of books.
</p>

<p>
Here then we have the definite first opening up of the
intellectual process in which we live to-day; here we have
the systematic gathering and distribution of knowledge.  The
foundation of this Museum and Library marks one of the great
epochs in the history of mankind.  It is the true beginning
of Modern History.

<p>
Both the work of research and the work of dissemination went
on under serious handicaps.  One of these was the great
social gap that <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P152"></a>152}</span>separated the philosopher, who was
a gentleman, from the trader and the artisan.  There were
glass workers and metal workers in abundance in those days,
but they were not in mental contact with the thinkers.  The
glass worker was making the most beautifully coloured beads
and phials and so forth, but he never made a Florentine flask
or a lens.  Clear glass does not seem to have interested him.
  The metal worker made weapons and jewellery but he never made
a chemical balance.  The philosopher speculated loftily about
atoms and the nature of things, but he had no practical
experience of enamels and pigments and philters and so forth.
  He was not interested in substances.  So Alexandria in its
brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no
chemistry.  And though Hero invented a steam engine it was
never set either to pump or drive a boat or do any useful
thing.  There were few practical applications of science
except in the realm of medicine, and the progress of science
was not stimulated and sustained by the interest and
excitement of practical applications.  There was nothing to
keep the work going therefore when the intellectual curiosity
of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P153"></a>153}</span>II was withdrawn.  The discoveries
of the Museum went on record in obscure manuscripts and
never, until the revival of scientific curiosity at the
Renascence, reached out to the mass of mankind.
</p>

<p>
Nor did the Library produce any improvements in book making.
  That ancient world had no paper made in definite sizes from
rag pulp.  Paper was a Chinese invention and it did not reach
the western world until the ninth century
 <small>A.D.</small>  The only book materials were parchment and
strips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge.  These strips
were kept on rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to and
fro and read, and very inconvenient for reference.  It was
these things that prevented the development of paged and
printed books.  Printing itself was known in the world it
would seem as early as the Old Stone Age; there were seals in
ancient Sumeria; but without abundant paper there was little
advantage in printing books, an improvement that may further
have been resisted by trades unionism on the part of the
copyists employed.  Alexandria produced abundant books but
not cheap books, and it never spread knowledge into the
population of the ancient world below the level of a wealthy
and influential class.

So it was that this blaze of intellectual enterprise never
reached beyond a small circle of people in touch with the
group of philosophers collected by the first two Ptolemies.
  It was like the light in a dark lantern which is shut off
from the world at large.  Within the blaze may be blindingly
bright, but nevertheless it is unseen.  The rest of the world
went on its old ways unaware that the seed of scientific
knowledge that was one day to revolutionize it altogether had
been sown.  Presently a darkness of bigotry fell even upon
<span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P154"></a>154}</span>Alexandria. Thereafter for a
thousand years of darkness the seed that Aristotle had sown
lay hidden.  Then it stirred and began to germinate.  In a
few centuries it had become that widespread growth of
knowledge and clear ideas that is now changing the whole of
human life.

Alexandria was not the only centre of Greek intellectual
activity in the third century <small>B.C.</small>
There were many other cities that displayed a brilliant
intellectual life amidst the disintegrating fragments of the
brief empire of Alexander.  There was, for example, the Greek
city of Syracuse in Sicily, where thought and science
flourished for two centuries; there was Pergamum in Asia
Minor, which also had a great library.  But this brilliant
Hellenic world was now stricken by invasion from the north.
  New Nordic barbarians, the Gauls, were striking down along
the tracks that had once been followed by the ancestors of
the Greeks and Phrygians and Macedonians.  They raided,
shattered and destroyed.  And in the wake of the Gauls came a
new conquering people out of Italy, the Romans, who gradually
subjugated all the western half of the vast realm of Darius
and Alexander.  They were an able but unimaginative people,
preferring law and profit to either science or art.  <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P155"></a>155}</span>New invaders
were also coming down out of central Asia to shatter and
subdue the Seleucid empire and to cut off the western world
again from India.  These were the Parthians, hosts of mounted
bowmen, who treated the Gr&#230;co-Persian empire of
Persepolis and Susa in the third century
 <small>B.C.</small> in much the same fashion that the Medes and
Persians had treated it in the seventh and sixth.  And there
were now other nomadic peoples also coming out of the
northeast, peoples who were not fair and Nordic and Aryan-
speaking but yellow-skinned and black-haired and with a
Mongolian speech.  But of these latter people we shall tell
more in a subsequent chapter.

<h4 align="center">THE LIFE OF GAUTAMA BUDDHA</h4>

<p>

BUT now we must go back three centuries in our story to tell
of a great teacher who came near to revolutionizing the
religious thought and feeling of all Asia.  This was Gautama
Buddha, who taught his disciples at Benares in India about
the same time that Isaiah was prophesying among the Jews in
Babylon and Heraclitus was carrying on his speculative
enquiries into the nature of things at Ephesus.  All these
men were in the world at the same time, in the sixth century
<small>B.C.</small>&#8212;unaware of one another.
</p>

<p>
This sixth century <small>B.C.</small> was indeed
one of the most remarkable in all history.
  Everywhere&#8212;for as we shall tell it was also the case in
China&#8212;men&rsquo;s minds were displaying a new boldness.
  Everywhere they were waking up out of the traditions of
kingships and priests and blood sacrifices and asking the
most penetrating questions.  It is as if the race had reached
a stage of adolescence&#8212;after a childhood of twenty
thousand years.
</p>

<p>
The early history of India is still very obscure.  Somewhen
perhaps about 2000 <small>B.C.</small>, an Aryan-
speaking people came down from the north-west into India
either in one invasion or in a series of invasions; and was
able to spread its language and traditions over most of north
India.  Its peculiar variety of Aryan speech was the
Sanskrit.  They found a brunette people with a more elaborate
civilization and less vigour of will, in possession of the
country of the Indus and Ganges.  But they do not seem to
have mingled with their predecessors as freely as did the
Greeks and Persians.  They remained aloof.  When the past of
India becomes dimly visible to the historian, Indian society
is already stratified into several layers, with a variable
number of sub-divisions, which do not eat together nor
intermarry nor associate freely.  And throughout history this
<span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P157"></a>157}</span>stratification into castes
continues.  This makes the Indian population something
different from the simple, freely inter-breeding European or
Mongolian communities.  It is really a community of
communities.
</p>

<p>
Siddhattha Gautama was the son of an aristocratic family
which ruled a small district on the Himalayan slopes.  He was
married at nineteen to a beautiful cousin.  He hunted and
played and went about in his sunny world of gardens and
groves and irrigated rice-fields.  And it was amidst this
life that a great discontent fell upon him.  It was the
unhappiness of a fine brain that seeks employment.  He felt
that the existence he was leading was not the reality of
life, but a holiday&#8212;a holiday that had gone on too
long.
</p>

<p>
The sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the
un-satisfactoriness of all happiness, descended upon the mind
of Gautama.  While he was in this mood he met one of those
wandering ascetics who already existed in great numbers in
India.  These men lived under severe rules, spending much
time in meditation and in religious discussion.  They were
supposed to be seeking some deeper reality in life, and a
passionate desire to do likewise took possession of Gautama.
</p>

<p>
He was meditating upon this project, says the story, when the
news was brought to him that his wife had been delivered of
his first-born son. &ldquo;This is another tie to
break,&rdquo; said Gautama.
</p>

<p>
He returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his
fellow clansmen.  There was a great feast and a Nautch dance
to celebrate the birth of this new tie, and in the night
Gautama awoke in a great agony of spirit, &ldquo;like a man
who is told that his house is on fire.&rdquo;  He resolved to
leave his happy aimless life forthwith.  He went softly to
the threshold of his wife&rsquo;s chamber, and saw her by the
light of a little oil lamp, sleeping sweetly, surrounded by
flowers, with his infant son in her arms.  He felt a great
craving to take up the child in one first and last embrace
before he departed, but the fear of waking his wife prevented
him, and at last he turned away and went out into the bright
Indian moonshine and mounted his horse and rode off into the
world.

Very far he rode that night, and in the morning he stopped
outside <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P159"></a>159}</span>the lands of his clan, and
dismounted beside a sandy river.  There he cut off his
flowing locks with his sword, removed all his ornaments and
sent them and his horse and sword back to his house.  Going
on he presently met a ragged man and exchanged clothes with
him, and so having divested himself of all worldly
entanglements he was free to pursue his search after wisdom.
  He made his way southward to a resort of hermits and teachers
in a hilly spur of the Vindhya Mountains.  There lived a
number of wise men in a warren of caves, going into the town
for their simple supplies and imparting their knowledge by
word of mouth to such as cared to come to them.  Gautama
became versed in all the metaphysics of his age.  But his
acute intelligence was dissatisfied with the solutions
offered him.

<p>
The Indian mind has always been disposed to believe that
power and knowledge may be obtained by extreme asceticism, by
fasting, sleeplessness, and self-torment, and these ideas
Gautama now put to the test.  He betook himself with five
disciple companions to the jungle and there he gave himself
up to fasting and terrible penances.  His fame spread,
&ldquo;like the sound of a great <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P160"></a>160}</span>bell hung in the canopy of the
skies.&rdquo;  But it brought him no sense of truth achieved.
  One day he was walking up and down, trying to think in spite
of his enfeebled state.  Suddenly he fell unconscious.  When
he recovered, the preposterousness of these semi-magical ways
to wisdom was plain to him.

<p>
He horrified his companions by demanding ordinary food and
refusing to continue his mortifications.  He had realized
that whatever truth a man may reach is reached best by a
nourished brain in a healthy body.  Such a conception was
absolutely foreign to the ideas of the land and age.  His
disciples deserted him, and went off in a melancholy state to
Benares.  Gautama wandered alone.
</p>

<p>
When the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem, it
makes its advances step by step, with but little realization
of the gains it has made, until suddenly, with an effect of
abrupt illumination, it realizes its victory.  So it happened
to Gautama.  He had seated himself under a great tree by the
side of a river to eat, when this sense of clear vision came
to him.  It seemed to him that he saw life plain.  He is said
to have sat all day and all night in profound thought, and
then he rose up to impart his vision to the world.
</p>

<p>
He went on to Benares and there he sought out and won back
his lost disciples to his new teaching.  In the King&rsquo;s
Deer Park at Benares they built themselves huts and set up a
sort of school to which came many who were seeking after
wisdom.
</p>

<p>
The starting point of his teaching was his own question as a
fortunate <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P161"></a>161}</span>young man, &ldquo;Why am I not
completely happy?&rdquo;  It was an introspective question.
  It was a question very different in quality from the frank
and self-forgetful <i>externalized</i> curiosity with which
Thales and Heraclitus were attacking the problems of the
universe, or the equally self-forgetful burthen of moral
obligation that the culminating prophets were imposing upon
the Hebrew mind.  The Indian teacher did not forget self, he
concentrated upon self and sought to destroy it.  All
suffering, he taught, was due to the greedy desires of the
individual.  Until man has conquered his personal cravings
his life is trouble and his end sorrow.  There were three
principal forms that the craving for life took and they were
all evil.  The first was the desire of the appetites, greed
and all forms of sensuousness, the second was the desire for
a personal and egotistic immortality, the third was the
craving for personal success, worldliness, avarice and the
like.  All these forms of desire had to be overcome to escape
from the distresses and chagrins of life.  When they were
overcome, when self had vanished altogether, then serenity of
soul, Nirvana, the highest good was attained.
</p>

<p>
This was the gist of his teaching, a very subtle and
metaphysical teaching indeed, not nearly so easy to
understand as the Greek injunction to see and know fearlessly
and rightly and the Hebrew command to fear God and accomplish
righteousness.  It was a teaching much beyond the
understanding of even Gautama&rsquo;s immediate disciples,
and it is no wonder that so soon as his personal influence
was withdrawn it became corrupted and coarsened.  There was a
widespread belief in India at that time that at long
intervals Wisdom came to earth and was incarnate in some
chosen person who was known as the Buddha.  Gautama&rsquo;s
disciples declared that he was a Buddha, the latest of the
Buddhas, though there is no evidence that he himself ever
accepted the title.  Before he was well dead, a cycle of
fantastic legends began to be woven about him.  The human
heart has always preferred a wonder story to a moral effort,
and Gautama Buddha became very wonderful.
</p>

<p>
Yet there remained a substantial gain in the world.  If
Nirvana was too high and subtle for most men&rsquo;s
imaginations, if the myth-making impulse in the race was too
strong for the simple facts of Gautama&rsquo;s life, they
could at least grasp something of the intention <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P162"></a>162}</span>of what
Gautama called the Eight-fold way, the Aryan or Noble Path in
life.  In this there was an insistence upon mental
uprightness, upon right aims and speech, right conduct and
honest livelihood.  There was a quickening of the conscience
and an appeal to generous and self-forgetful ends.

<p>

FOR some generations after the death of Gautama, these high
and noble Buddhist teachings, this first plain teaching that
the highest good for man is the subjugation of self, made
comparatively little headway in the world.  Then they
conquered the imagination of one of the greatest monarchs the
world has ever seen.
</p>

<p>
We have already mentioned how Alexander the Great came down
into India and fought with Porus upon the Indus.  It is
related by the Greek historians that a certain Chandragupta
Maurya came into Alexander&rsquo;s camp and tried to persuade
him to go on to the Ganges and conquer all India.  Alexander
could not do this because of the refusal of his Macedonians
to go further into what was for them an unknown world, and
later on (303 <small>B.C.</small>) Chandragupta was
able to secure the help or various hill tribes and realize
his dream without Greek help.  He built up an empire in North
India and was presently (303 <small>B.C.</small>)
able to attack Seleucus I in the Punjab and drive the last
vestige of Greek power out of India.  His son extended this
new empire.  His grandson, Asoka, the monarch of whom we now
have to tell, found himself in 264 <small>B.C.</small>
 ruling from Afghanistan to Madras.
</p>

<p>
Asoka was at first disposed to follow the example of his
father and grandfather and complete the conquest of the
Indian peninsula.  He invaded Kalinga (255 <small>B.C.</small>), a
 country on the east coast of Madras, he
was successful in his military operations and&#8212;alone
among conquerors&#8212;he was so disgusted by the cruelty and
horror of war that he renounced it.  He would have no more of
it.  He adopted the peaceful doctrines of Buddhism and
declared that henceforth his conquests should be the
conquests of religion.

Such was Asoka, greatest of kings.  He was far in advance of
his age.  He left no prince and no organization of men to
carry on his work, and within a century of his death the
great days of his reign had become a glorious memory in a
shattered and decaying India.  The priestly caste of the
Brahmins, the highest and most privileged caste in the Indian
social body, has always been opposed to the frank and open
teaching of Buddha.  Gradually they undermined the Buddhist
influence in the land.  The old monstrous gods, the
innumerable cults of Hinduism, resumed their sway.  Caste
became <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P166"></a>166}</span>more rigorous and complicated.
  For long centuries Buddhism and Brahminism flourished side by
side, and then slowly Buddhism decayed and Brahminism in a
multitude of forms replaced it.  But beyond the confines of
India and the realms of caste Buddhism spread&#8212;until it
had won China and Siam and Burma and Japan, countries in
which it is predominant to this day.

<h4 align="center">CONFUCIUS AND LAO TSE</h4>

<p>
WE have still to tell of two other great men, Confucius and
Lao Tse, who lived in that wonderful century which began the
adolescence of mankind, the sixth century <small>B.C.</small>
  In this history thus far we have told very
little of the early story of China.  At present that early
history is still very obscure, and we look to Chinese
explorers and arch&#230;olologists in the new China that is
now arising to work out their past as thoroughly as the
European past has been worked out during the last century.
  Very long ago the first primitive Chinese civilizations arose
in the great river valleys out of the primordial heliolithic
culture.  They had, like Egypt and Sumeria, the general
characteristics of that culture, and they centred upon
temples in which priests and priest kings offered the
seasonal blood sacrifices.  The life in those cities must
have been very like the Egyptian and Sumerian life of six or
seven thousand years ago and very like the Maya life of
Central America a thousand years ago.
</p>

<p>
If there were human sacrifices they had long given way to
animal sacrifices before the dawn of history.  And a form of
picture writing was growing up long before a thousand years
<small>B.C.</small>
</p>

<p>
And just as the primitive civilizations of Europe and western
Asia were in conflict with the nomads of the desert and the
nomads of the north, so the primitive Chinese civilizations
had a great cloud of nomadic peoples on their northern
borders.  There was a number of tribes akin in language and
ways of living, who are spoken of in history in succession as
the Huns, the Mongols, the Turks and Tartars.  They changed
and divided and combined and re-combined, just as the Nordic
peoples in north Europe and central Asia changed and varied
in name rather than in nature.  These Mongolian nomads had
horses earlier than the Nordic peoples, and it may <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P168"></a>168}</span>be that in the
region of the Altai Mountains they made an independent
discovery of iron somewhen after 1000 <small>B.C.</small>
  And just as in the western case so ever and
again these eastern nomads would achieve a sort of political
unity, and become the conquerors and masters and revivers of
this or that settled and civilized region.
</p>

<p>
It is quite possible that the earliest civilization of China
was not Mongolian at all any more than the earliest
civilization of Europe and western Asia was Nordic or
Semitic.  It is quite possible that the earliest civilization
of China was a brunette civilization and of a piece with the
earliest Egyptian, Sumerian and Dravidian civilizations, and
that when the first recorded history of China began there had
already been conquests and intermixture.  At any rate we find
that by 1750 <small>B.C.</small> China was already a
vast system of little kingdoms and city states, all
acknowledging a loose allegiance and paying more or less
regularly, more or less definite feudal dues to one great
priest emperor, the &ldquo;Son of Heaven.&rdquo;  The
&ldquo;Shang&rdquo; dynasty came to an end in 1125
 <small>B.C.</small>  A &ldquo;Chow&rdquo; dynasty succeeded
&ldquo;Shang,&rdquo; and maintained China in a relaxing unity
until the days of Asoka in India and of the Ptolemies in
Egypt.  Gradually China went to pieces during that long
&ldquo;Chow&rdquo; period.  Hunnish peoples came down and set
up principalities; local rulers discontinued their tribute
and became independent.  There was in the sixth century
<small>B.C.</small>, says one Chinese authority, five or
six thousand practically independent states in China.  It was
what the Chinese call in their records an &ldquo;Age of
Confusion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But this Age of Confusion was compatible with much
intellectual activity and with the existence of many local
centres of art and civilized living.  When we know more of
Chinese history we shall find that China also had her Miletus
and her Athens, her Pergamum and her Macedonia.  At present
we must be vague and brief about this period of Chinese
division simply because our knowledge is not sufficient for
us to frame a coherent and consecutive story.

<p>
And just as in divided Greece there were philosophers and in
shattered and captive Jewry prophets, so in disordered China
there were philosophers and teachers at this time.  In all
these cases <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P170"></a>170}</span>insecurity and uncertainty seemed
to have quickened the better sort of mind.  Confucius was a
man of aristocratic origin and some official importance in a
small state called Lu.  Here in a very parallel mood to the
Greek impulse he set up a sort of Academy for discovering and
teaching Wisdom.  The lawlessness and disorder of China
distressed him profoundly.  He conceived an ideal of a better
government and a better life, and travelled from state to
state seeking a prince who would carry out his legislative
and educational ideas.  He never found his prince; he found a
prince, but court intrigues undermined the influence of the
teacher and finally defeated his reforming proposals.  It is
interesting to note that a century and a half later the Greek
philosopher Plato also sought a prince, and was for a time
adviser to the tyrant Dionysius who ruled Syracuse in Sicily.
</p>

<p>
Confucius died a disappointed man.  &ldquo;No intelligent
ruler arises to take me as his master,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and my time has come to die.&rdquo;  But his teaching
had more vitality than he imagined in his declining and
hopeless years, and it became a great formative influence
with the Chinese people.  It became one of what the Chinese
call the Three Teachings, the other two being those of Buddha
and of Lao Tse.
</p>

<p>
The gist of the teaching of Confucius was the way of the
noble or aristocratic man.  He was concerned with personal
conduct as much as Gautama was concerned with the peace of
self-forgetfulness and the Greek with external knowledge and
the Jew with righteousness.  He was the most public-minded of
all great teachers.  He was supremely concerned by the
confusion and miseries of the world, and he wanted to make
men noble in order to bring about a noble world.  He sought
to regulate conduct to an extraordinary extent; to provide
sound rules for every occasion in life.  A polite, public-
spirited gentleman, rather sternly self-disciplined, was the
ideal he found already developing in the northern Chinese
world and one to which he gave a permanent form.

<p>
The teaching of Lao Tse, who was for a long time in charge of
the imperial library of the Chow dynasty, was much more
mystical and vague and elusive than that of Confucius.  He
seems to have preached a stoical indifference to the
pleasures and powers of the <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P172"></a>172}</span>world and a return to an imaginary
simple life of the past.  He left writings very contracted in
style and very obscure.  He wrote in riddles.  After his
death his teachings, like the teachings of Gautama Buddha,
were corrupted and overlaid by legends and had the most
complex and extraordinary observances and superstitious ideas
grafted upon them.  In China just as in India primordial
ideas of magic and monstrous legends out of the childish past
of our race struggled against the new thinking in the world
and succeeded in plastering it over with grotesque,
irrational and antiquated observances.  Both Buddhism and
Taoism (which ascribes itself largely to Lao Tse) as one
finds them in China now, are religions of monk, temple,
priest and offering of a type as ancient in form, if not in
thought, as the sacrificial religions of ancient Sumeria and
Egypt.  But the teaching <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P173"></a>173}</span>of Confucius was not so overlaid
because it was limited and plain and straightforward and lent
itself to no such distortions.

China, became Taoist.  Since those days a conflict has always
been traceable in Chinese affairs between these two spirits,
the spirit of the north and the spirit of the south, between
(in latter times) Pekin and Nankin, between the official-
minded, upright and conservative north, and the sceptical,
artistic, lax and experimental south.
</p>

<p>
The divisions of China of the Age of Confusion reached their
worst stage in the sixth century <small>B.C.</small>
The Chow dynasty was so enfeebled and so discredited that Lao
Tse left the unhappy court and retired into private life.
</p>

<p>
Three nominally subordinate powers dominated the situation in
those days, Ts&rsquo;i and Ts&rsquo;in, both northern powers,
and Ch&rsquo;u, which was an aggressive military power in the
Yangtse valley.  At last Ts&rsquo;i and Ts&rsquo;in formed an
alliance, subdued Ch&rsquo;u and imposed a general treaty of
disarmament and peace in China.  The power of Ts&rsquo;in
became predominant.  Finally about the time of Asoka in India
the Ts&rsquo;in monarch seized upon the sacrificial vessels
of the Chow emperor and took over his sacrificial duties.
  His son, Shi-Hwang-ti (king in 246
 <small>B.C.</small>, emperor in 220
 <small>B.C.</small>), is called in the Chinese Chronicles
&ldquo;the First Universal Emperor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
More fortunate than Alexander, Shi-Hwang-ti reigned for
thirty-six years as king and emperor.  His energetic reign
marks the beginning of a new era of unity and prosperity for
the Chinese people.  He fought vigorously against the Hunnish
invaders from the northern deserts, and he began that immense
work, the Great Wall of China, to set a limit to their
incursions.

<h4 align="center">ROME COMES INTO HISTORY</h4>

<p>

THE reader will note a general similarity in the history of
all these civilizations in spite of the effectual separation
caused by the great barriers of the Indian north-west
frontier and of the mountain masses of Central Asia and
further India.  First for thousands of years the heliolithic
culture spread over all the warm and fertile river valleys of
the old world and developed a temple system and priest rulers
about its sacrificial traditions.  Apparently its first
makers were always those brunette peoples we have spoken of
as the central race of mankind.  Then the nomads came in from
the regions of seasonal grass and seasonal migrations and
superposed their own characteristics and often their own
language on the primitive civilization.  They subjugated and
stimulated it, and were stimulated to fresh developments and
made it here one thing and here another.  In Mesopotamia it
was the Elamite and then the Semite, and at last the Nordic
Medes and Persians and the Greeks who supplied the ferment;
over the region of the &#198;gean peoples it was the Greeks;
in India it was the Aryan-speakers; in Egypt there was a
thinner infusion of conquerors into a more intensely
saturated priestly civilization; in China, the Hun conquered
and was absorbed and was followed by fresh Huns.  China was
Mongolized just as Greece and North India were Aryanized and
Mesopotamia Semitized and Aryanized.  Everywhere the nomads
destroyed much, but everywhere they brought in a new spirit
of free enquiry and moral innovation.  They questioned the
beliefs of immemorial ages.  They let daylight into the
temples.  They set up kings who were neither priests nor gods
but mere leaders among their captains and companions.

<p>
In the centuries following the sixth century <small>B.C.</small>
 we find everywhere a great breaking down of
ancient traditions and a new spirit <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P176"></a>176}</span>of moral and intellectual enquiry
awake, a spirit never more to be altogether stilled in the
great progressive movement of mankind.  We find reading and
writing becoming common and accessible accomplishments among
the ruling and prosperous minority; they were no longer the
jealously guarded secret of the priests.  Travel is
increasing and transport growing easier by reason of horses
and roads.  A new and easy device to facilitate trade has
been found in coined money.
</p>

<p>
Let us now transfer our attention back from China in the
extreme east of the old world to the western half of the
Mediterranean.  Here we have to note the appearance of a city
which was destined to play at last a very great part indeed
in human affairs, Rome.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto we have told very little about Italy in our story.
  It was before 1000 <small>B.C.</small> a land of
mountain and forest and thinly populated.  Aryan-speaking
tribes had pressed down this peninsula and formed little
towns and cities, and the southern extremity was studded with
Greek settlements.  The noble ruins of P&#230;stum preserve
for us to this day something of the dignity and splendour of
these early Greek establishments.  A non-Aryan people,
probably akin to the &#198;gean peoples, the Etruscans, had
established themselves in the central part of the peninsula.
  They had reversed the usual process by subjugating various
Aryan tribes.  Rome, when it comes into the light of history,
is a little trading city at a ford on the Tiber, with a
Latin-speaking population ruled over by Etruscan kings.  The
old chronologies gave 753 <small>B.C.</small> as the
date of the founding of Rome, half a century later than the
founding of the great Ph&#339;nician city of Carthage and
twenty-three years after the first Olympiad.  Etruscan tombs
of a much earlier date than 753 <small>B.C.</small>
have, however, been excavated in the Roman Forum.
</p>

<p>
In that red-letter century, the sixth century
 <small>B.C.</small>, the Etruscan kings were expelled (510
 <small>B.C.</small>) and Rome became an aristocratic
republic with a lordly class of &ldquo;patrician&rdquo;
families dominating a commonalty of &ldquo;plebeians.&rdquo;
Except that it spoke Latin it was not unlike many
aristocratic Greek republics.
</p>

<p>
For some centuries the internal history of Rome was the story
of a long and obstinate struggle for freedom and a share in
the government on the part of the plebeians.  It would not be
difficult to find <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P177"></a>177}</span>Greek parallels to this conflict,
which the Greeks would have called a conflict of aristocracy
with democracy.  In the end the plebeians broke down most of
the exclusive barriers of the old families and established a
working equality with them.  They destroyed the old
exclusiveness, and made it possible and acceptable for Rome
to extend her citizenship by the inclusion of more and more
&ldquo;outsiders.&rdquo;  For while she still struggled at
home, she was extending her power abroad.

<p>
The extension of Roman power began in the fifth century
 <small>B.C.</small>  Until that time they had waged war,
and generally unsuccessful war, with the Etruscans.  There
was an Etruscan fort, Veii, only a few miles from Rome which
the Romans had never been able to capture.  In 474
 <small>B.C.</small>, however, a great misfortune came to the
Etruscans.  Their fleet was destroyed by the Greeks of
Syracuse in Sicily.  <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P178"></a>178}</span>At the same time a wave of Nordic
invaders came down upon them from the north, the Gauls.
  Caught between Roman and Gaul, the Etruscans fell&#8212;and
disappear from history.  Veii was captured by the Romans, The
Gauls came through to Rome and sacked the city (390
 <small>B.C.</small><small>A.D.</small>) but could not capture the
 Capitol.
  An attempted night surprise was betrayed by the cackling of
some geese, and finally the invaders were bought off and
retired to the north of Italy again.
</p>

<p>
The Gaulish raid seems to have invigorated rather than
weakened Rome.  The Romans conquered and assimilated the
Etruscans, and extended their power over all central Italy
from the Arno to Naples.  To this they had reached within a
few years of 300 <small>B.C.</small>  Their
conquests in Italy were going on simultaneously with the
growth of Philip&rsquo;s power in Macedonia and Greece, and
the tremendous raid of Alexander to Egypt and the Indus.  The
Romans had become notable people in the civilized world to
the east of them by the break-up of Alexander&rsquo;s empire.
</p>

<p>
To the north of the Roman power were the Gauls; to the south
of them were the Greek settlements of Magna Gr&#230;cia, that
is to say of Sicily and of the toe and heel of Italy.  The
Gauls were a hardy, warlike people and the Romans held that
boundary by a line of forts and fortified settlements.  The
Greek cities in the south headed by Tarentum (now Taranto)
and by Syracuse in Sicily, did not so much threaten as fear
the Romans.  They looked about for some help against these
new conquerors.
</p>

<p>
We have already told how the empire of Alexander fell to
pieces and was divided among his generals and companions.
  Among these adventurers was a kinsman of Alexander&rsquo;s
named Pyrrhus, who established himself in Epirus, which is
across the Adriatic Sea over against the heel of Italy.  It
was his ambition to play the part of Philip of Macedonia to
Magna Gr&#230;cia, and to become protector and master-general
of Tarentum, Syracuse and the rest of that part of the world.
  He had what was then it very efficient modern army; he had an
infantry phalanx, cavalry from Thessaly&#8212;which was now
quite as good as the original Macedonian cavalry&#8212;and
twenty fighting elephants; he invaded Italy and routed the
Romans in two considerable battles, Heraclea (280
 <small>B.C.</small>) and Ausculum (279
 <small>B.C.</small>), and <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P179"></a>179}</span>having driven them north, he
turned his attention to the subjugation of Sicily.
</p>

<p>
But this brought against him a more formidable enemy than
were the Romans at that time, the Ph&#339;nician trading city
of Carthage, which was probably then the greatest city in the
world.  Sicily was too near Carthage for a new Alexander to
be welcome there, and Carthage was mindful of the fate that
had befallen her mother city Tyre half a century before.  So
she sent a fleet to encourage or compel Rome to continue the
struggle, and she cut the overseas communications of Pyrrhus.
  Pyrrhus found himself freshly assailed by the Romans, and
suffered a disastrous repulse in an attack he had made upon
their camp at Beneventum between Naples and Rome.
</p>

<p>
And suddenly came news that recalled him to Epirus.  The
Gauls were raiding south.  But this time they were not
raiding down into Italy; the Roman frontier, fortified and
guarded, had become too formidable for them.  They were
raiding down through Illyria (which is now Serbia and
Albania) to Macedonia and Epirus.  Repulsed by the Romans,
endangered at sea by the Carthaginians, and threatened at
home by the Gauls, Pyrrhus abandoned his dream of conquest
and went home (275 <small>B.C.</small>), and the
power of Rome was extended to the Straits of Messina.
</p>

<p>
On the Sicilian side of the Straits was the Greek city of
Messina, and this presently fell into the hands of a gang of
pirates.  The Carthaginians, who were already practically
overlords of Sicily and allies of Syracuse, suppressed these
pirates (270 <small>B.C.</small>) and put in a
Carthaginian garrison there.  The pirates appealed to Rome
and Rome listened to their complaint.  And so across the
Straits of Messina the great trading power of Carthage and
this new conquering people, the Romans, found themselves in
antagonism, face to face.

<h4 align="center">ROME AND CARTHAGE</h4>

<p>

IT was in 264 <small>B.C.</small> that the great
struggle between Rome and Carthage, the Punic Wars, began.
  In that year Asoka was beginning his reign in Behar and Shi-
Hwang-ti was a little child, the Museum in Alexandria was
still doing good scientific work, and the barbaric Gauls were
now in Asia Minor and exacting a tribute from Pergamum.  The
different regions of the world were still separated by
insurmountable distances, and probably the rest of mankind
heard only vague and remote rumours of the mortal fight that
went on for a century and a half in Spain, Italy, North
Africa and the western Mediterranean, between the last
stronghold of Semitic power and Rome, this newcomer among
Aryan-speaking peoples.
</p>

<p>
That war has left its traces upon issues that still stir the
world.  Rome triumphed over Carthage, but the rivalry of
Aryan and Semite was to merge itself later on in the conflict
of Gentile and Jew.  Our history now is coming to events
whose consequences and distorted traditions still maintain a
lingering and expiring vitality in, and exercise a
complicating and confusing influence upon, the conflicts and
controversies of to-day.
</p>

<p>
The First Punic War began in 264 <small>B.C.</small>
about the pirates of Messina.  It developed into a struggle
for the possession of all Sicily except the dominions of the
Greek king of Syracuse.  The advantage of the sea was at
first with the Carthaginians.  They had great fighting ships
of what was hitherto an unheard-of size, quinqueremes,
galleys with five banks of oars and a huge ram.  At the
battle of Salamis, two centuries before, the leading
battleships had only been triremes with three banks.  But the
Romans, with extraordinary energy and in spite of the fact
that they had little naval experience, set themselves to
outbuild the Carthaginians.  They manned the new navy they
created chiefly with Greek seamen, and they invented <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P181"></a>181}</span>grappling and
boarding to make up for the superior seamanship of the enemy.
  When the Carthaginian came up to ram or shear the oars of the
Roman, huge grappling irons seized him and the Roman soldiers
swarmed aboard him.  At Myl&#230; (260
 <small>B.C.</small>) and at Ecnomus (256
 <small>B.C.</small>) the Carthaginians were disastrously beaten.
  They repulsed a Roman landing near Carthage but were badly
beaten at Palermo, losing one hundred and four elephants
there&#8212;to grace such a triumphal procession through the
Forum as Rome had never seen before.  But after that came two
Roman defeats and then a Roman recovery.  The last naval
forces of Carthage were defeated <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P182"></a>182}</span>by it last Roman effort at the
battle of the &#198;gatian Isles (241
 <small>B.C.</small>) and Carthage sued for peace.  All Sicily
except the dominions of Hiero, king of Syracuse, was ceded to
the Romans.

<p>
For twenty-two years Rome and Carthage kept the peace.  Both
had trouble enough at home.  In Italy the Gauls came south
again, threatened Rome&#8212;<i>which in a state of panic
offered human sacrifices to the Gods!</i>&#8212;and were
routed at Telamon.  Rome pushed forward to the Alps, and even
extended her dominions down the Adriatic coast to Illyria.
  Carthage suffered from domestic insurrections and from
revolts in Corsica and Sardinia, and displayed far less
recuperative power.  Finally, an act of intolerable
aggression, Rome seized and annexed the two revolting
islands.
</p>

<p>
Spain at that time was Carthaginian as far north as the river
Ebro.  To that boundary the Romans restricted them.  Any
crossing of the Ebro by the Carthaginians was to be
considered an act of war against the Romans.  At last in 218
<small>B.C.</small> the Carthaginians, provoked by
new Roman aggressions, did cross this river under a young
general named Hannibal, one of the most brilliant commanders
in the whole of history.  He marched his army from Spain over
the Alps into Italy, raised the Gauls against the Romans, and
carried on the Second Punic War in Italy itself for fifteen
years.  He inflicted tremendous defeats upon the Romans at
Lake Trasimere and at Cann&#230;, and throughout all his
Italian campaigns no Roman army stood against him and escaped
disaster.  But a Roman army had landed at Marseilles and cut
his communications with Spain; he had no siege train, and he
could never capture Rome.  Finally the Carthaginians,
threatened by the revolt of the Numidians at home, were
forced back upon the defence of their own city in Africa, a
Roman army crossed into Africa, and Hannibal experienced his
first defeat under its walls at the battle of Zama (202
 <small>B.C.</small> at the hands of Scipio Africanus the
Elder.  The battle of Zama ended this Second Punic War.
  Carthage capitulated; she surrendered Spain and her war
fleet; she paid an enormous indemnity and agreed to give up
Hannibal to the vengeance of the Romans.  But Hannibal
escaped and fled to Asia where later, being in danger of
falling into the hands of his relentless enemies, he took
poison and died.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P183"></a>183}</span>For
fifty-six years Rome and the shorn city of Carthage were at
peace.  And meanwhile Rome spread her empire over confused
and divided Greece, invaded Asia Minor, and defeated
Antiochus III, the Seleucid monarch, at Magnesia in Lydia.
  She made Egypt, still under the Ptolemies, and Pergamum and
most of the small states of Asia Minor into
&ldquo;Allies,&rdquo; or, as we should call them now,
&ldquo;protected states.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Carthage, subjugated and enfeebled, had been slowly
regaining something of her former prosperity.  Her recovery
revived the hate and suspicion of the Romans.  She was
attacked upon the most shallow and artificial of quarrels
(149 <small>B.C.</small>), she made an obstinate and
bitter resistance, stood a long siege and was stormed (146
<small>B.C.</small>). The street fighting, or
massacre, lasted six days; it was extraordinarily bloody, and
when the citadel capitulated only about fifty thousand of the
Carthaginian population remained alive out of a quarter of a
million.  They were sold into slavery, and the city was burnt
and elaborately destroyed.  The blackened ruins were ploughed
and sown as a sort of ceremonial effacement.

</center>

<p>
So ended the Third Punic War.  Of all the Semitic states and
cities that had flourished in the world five centuries before
only one little country remained free under native rulers.
  This was Judea, which had liberated itself from the Seleucids
and was under the rule <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P184"></a>184}</span>of the native Maccabean princes.
  By this time it had its Bible almost complete, and was
developing the distinctive traditions of the Jewish world as
we know it now.  It was natural that the Carthaginians,
Phoenicians and kindred peoples dispersed about the world
should find a common link in their practically identical
language and in this literature of hope and courage.  To a
large extent they were still the traders and bankers of the
world.  The Semitic world had been submerged rather than
replaced.
</p>

<p>
Jerusalem, which has always been rather the symbol than the
centre of Judaism, was taken by the Romans in 65
 <small>B.C.</small>; and after various vicissitudes of quasi-
independence and revolt was besieged by them in 70
 <small>A.D.</small> and captured after a stubborn struggle.
  The Temple was destroyed.  A later rebellion in 132
 <small>A.D.</small> completed its destruction, and the
Jerusalem we know to-day was rebuilt later under Roman
auspices.  A temple to the Roman god, Jupiter Capitolinus,
stood in the place of the Temple, and Jews were forbidden to
inhabit the city.

<a name="chapXXXIII"></a><h3 align="center">XXXIII</h3>

<h4 align="center">THE GROWTH OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE</h4>

<p>

NOW this new Roman power which arose to dominate the western
world in the second and first centuries
 <small>B.C.</small> was in several respects a different thing
from any of the great empires that had hitherto prevailed in
the civilized world.  It was not at first a monarchy, and it
was not the creation of any one great conqueror.  It was not
indeed the first of republican empires; Athens had dominated
a group of Allies and dependents in the time of Pericles, and
Carthage when she entered upon her fatal struggle with Rome
was mistress of Sardinia and Corsica, Morocco, Algiers,
Tunis, and most of Spain and Sicily.  But it was the first
republican empire that escaped extinction and went on to
fresh developments.
</p>

<p>
The centre of this new system lay far to the west of the more
ancient centres of empire, which had hitherto been the river
valleys of Mesopotamia and Egypt.  This westward position
enabled Rome to bring in to civilization quite fresh regions
and peoples. The Roman power extended to Morocco and Spain,
and was presently able to thrust north-westward over what is
now France and Belgium to Britain and north-eastward into
Hungary and South Russia.  But on the other hand it was never
able to maintain itself in Central Asia or Persia because
they were too far from its administrative centres.  It
included therefore great masses of fresh Nordic Aryan-
speaking peoples, it presently incorporated nearly all the
Greek people in the world, and its population was less
strongly Hamitic and Semitic than that of any preceding
empire.
</p>

<p>
For some centuries this Roman Empire did not fall into the
grooves of precedent that had so speedily swallowed up
Persian and Greek, and all that time it developed.  The
rulers of the Medes and Persians became entirely Babylonized
in a generation or so; they <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P186"></a>186}</span>took over the tiara of the king of
kings and the temples and priesthoods of his gods; Alexander
and his successors followed in the same easy path of
assimilation; the Seleucid monarchs had much the same court
and administrative methods as Nebuchadnezzar; the Ptolemies
became Pharaohs and altogether Egyptian.  They were
assimilated just as before them the Semitic conquerors of the
Sumerians had been assimilated.  But the Romans ruled in
their own city, and for some centuries kept to the laws of
their own nature.  The only people who exercised any great
mental influence upon them before the second or third century
<small>A.D.</small> were the kindred and similar
Greeks.  So that the Roman Empire was essentially a first
attempt to rule a great dominion upon mainly Aryan lines.  It
was so far a new pattern in history, it was an expanded Aryan
republic.  The old pattern of a personal conqueror ruling
over a capital city that had grown up round the temple of a
harvest god did not apply to it.  The Romans had gods and
temples, but like the gods of the Greeks their gods were
quasi-human immortals, divine patricians.  The Romans also
had blood sacrifices and even made human ones in times of
stress, things they may have learnt to do from their dusky
Etruscan teachers; but until Rome was long past its zenith
neither priest nor temple played a large part in Roman
history.
</p>

<p>
The Roman Empire was a growth, an unplanned novel growth; the
Roman people found themselves engaged almost unawares in a
vast administrative experiment.  It cannot be called a
successful experiment.  In the end their empire collapsed
altogether.  And it changed enormously in form and method
from century to century.  It changed more in a hundred years
than Bengal or Mesopotamia or Egypt changed in a thousand.
  It was always changing.  It never attained to any fixity.
</p>

<p>
In a sense the experiment failed.  In a sense the experiment
remains unfinished, and Europe and America to-day are still
working out the riddles of world-wide statescraft first
confronted by the Roman people.
</p>

<p>
It is well for the student of history to bear in mind the
very great changes not only in political but in social and
moral matters that went on throughout the period of Roman
dominion.  There is much too strong a tendency in
people&rsquo;s minds to think of the Roman <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P187"></a>187}</span>rule as
something finished and stable, firm, rounded, noble and
decisive.  Macaulay&rsquo;s <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>,
S.P.Q.R. the elder Cato, the Scipios, Julius C&#230;sar,
Diocletian, Constantine the Great, triumphs, orations,
gladiatorial combats and Christian martyrs are all mixed up
together in a picture of something high and cruel and
dignified.  The items of that picture have to be
disentangled.  They are collected at different points from a
process of change profounder than that which separates the
London of William the Conqueror from the London of to-day.
</p>

<p>
We may very conveniently divide the expansion of Rome into
four stages.  The first stage began after the sack of Rome by
the Goths in 390 <small>B.C.</small> and went on
until the end of the First Punic War (240 B.C,).  We may call
this stage the stage of the Assimilative Republic.  It was
perhaps the finest, most characteristic stage in Roman
history.  The age-long dissensions of patrician and plebeian
were drawing to it close, the Etruscan threat had come to an
end, no one was very rich yet nor very poor, and most men
were public-spirited.  It was a republic like the republic of
the South African Boers before 1900 or like the northern
states of the American union between 1800 and 1850; a free-
farmers republic.  At the outset of this stage Rome was a
little state scarcely twenty miles square.  She fought the
sturdy but kindred states about her, and sought not their
destruction but coalescence.  Her centuries of civil
dissension had trained her people in compromise and
concessions.  Some of the defeated cities became altogether
Roman with a voting share in the government, some became
self-governing with the right to trade and marry in Rome;
garrisons full of citizens were set up at strategic points
and colonies of varied privileges founded among the freshly
conquered people.  Great roads were made.  The rapid
Latinization of all Italy was the inevitable consequence of
such a policy.  In 89 <small>B.C.</small> all the
free inhabitants of Italy became citizens of the city of
Rome.  Formally the whole Roman Empire became at last an
extended city.  In 212 <small>A.D.</small> every
free man in the entire extent of the empire was given
citizenship; the right, if he could get there, to vote in the
town meeting in Rome.
</p>

<p>
This extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to
whole countries was the distinctive device of Roman
expansion.  It <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P188"></a>188}</span>reversed the old process of
conquest and assimilation altogether.  By the Roman method
the conquerors assimilated the conquered.

THE FORUM AT ROME AS IT IS TO-DAY
</h4>
</center>

<p>
But after the First Punic War and the annexation of Sicily,
though the old process of assimilation still went on, another
process arose by its side.  Sicily for instance was treated
as a conquered prey.  It was declared an &ldquo;estate&rdquo;
of the Roman people.  Its rich soil and industrious
population was exploited to make Rome rich.  The patricians
and the more influential among the plebeians secured the
major share of that wealth.  And the war also brought in a
large supply of slaves.  Before the First Punic War the
population of the republic had been largely a population of
citizen farmers.  Military service was their privilege and
liability.  While they were on active service their farms
fell into debt and a new large-scale slave agriculture grew
up; when they returned they found their produce in
competition with slave-grown produce from Sicily and from the
new estates at home.  Times had changed.  The republic had
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P189"></a>189}</span>altered
its character.  Not only was Sicily in the hands of Rome, the
common man was in the hands of the rich creditor and the rich
competitor.  Rome had entered upon its second stage, the
Republic of Adventurous Rich Men.
</p>

<p>
For two hundred years the Roman soldier farmers had struggled
for freedom and a share in the government of their state; for
a hundred years they had enjoyed their privileges.  The First
Punic War wasted them and robbed them of all they had won.

<p>
The value of their electoral privileges had also evaporated.
  The governing bodies of the Roman republic were two in
number.  The first and more important was the Senate.  This
was a body originally of patricians and then of prominent men
of all sorts, who were summoned to it first by certain
powerful officials, the consuls and censors.  Like the
British House of Lords it became a gathering of great
landowners, prominent politicians, big business men and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P190"></a>190}</span>like.
  It was much more like the British House of Lords than it was
like the American Senate.  For three centuries, from the
Punic Wars onward, it was the centre of Roman political
thought and purpose.  The second body was the Popular
Assembly.  This was supposed to be an assembly of <i>all</i>
the citizens of Rome.  When Rome was a little state twenty
miles square this was a possible gathering.  When the
citizenship of Rome had spread beyond the confines in Italy,
it was an altogether impossible one.  Its meetings,
proclaimed by horn-blowing from the Capitol and the city
walls, became more and more a gathering of political hacks
and city riff-raff.  In the fourth century
 <small>B.C.</small> the Popular Assembly was a considerable check
upon the Senate, a competent representation of the claims and
rights of the common man.  By the end of the Punic Wars it
was an impotent relic of a vanquished popular control.  No
effectual legal check remained upon the big men.

<p>
Nothing of the nature of representative government was ever
introduced into the Roman republic.  No one thought of
electing delegates to represent the will of the citizens.
  This is a very important point for the student to grasp.  The
Popular Assembly <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P191"></a>191}</span>never became the equivalent of the
American House of Representatives or the British House of
Commons.  In theory it was all the citizens; in practice it
ceased to be anything at all worth consideration.
</p>

<p>
The common citizen of the Roman Empire was therefore in a
very poor case after the Second Punic War; he was
impoverished, he had often lost his farm, he was ousted from
profitable production by slaves, and he had no political
power left to him to remedy these things.  The only methods
of popular expression left to a people without any form of
political expression are the strike and the revolt.  The
story of the second and first centuries
 <small>B.C.</small>, so far as internal politics go, is a story
of futile revolutionary upheaval.  The scale of this history
will not permit us to tell of the intricate struggles of that
time, of the attempts to break up estates and restore the
land to the free farmer, of proposals to abolish debts in
whole or in part.  There was revolt and civil war.  In 73
<small>B.C.</small>, the distresses of Italy were
enhanced by a great insurrection, of the slaves under
Spartacus.  The slaves of Italy revolted with some effect,
for among them were the trained fighters of the gladiatorial
shows.  For two years Spartacus held out in the crater of
Vesuvius, which seemed at that time to be an extinct volcano.
  This insurrection was defeated at last and suppressed with
frantic cruelty.  Six thousand captured Spartacists were
crucified along the Appian Way, the great highway that runs
southward out of Rome (71 <small>B.C.</small>).
</p>

<p>
The common man never made head against the forces that were
subjugating and degrading him.  But the big rich men who were
overcoming him were even in his defeat preparing a new power
in the Roman world over themselves and him, the power of the
army.
</p>

<p>
Before the Second Punic War the army of Rome was a levy of
free farmers, who, according to their quality, rode or
marched afoot to battle.  This was a very good force for wars
close at hand, but not the sort of army that will go abroad
and bear long campaigns with patience.  And moreover as the
slaves multiplied and the estates grew, the supply of free-
spirited fighting farmers declined.  It was a popular leader
named Marius who introduced a new factor.  North Africa after
the overthrow of the Carthaginian civilization had become a
semi-barbaric kingdom, the kingdom of Numidia.  <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P192"></a>192}</span>The Roman
power fell into conflict with Jugurtha, king of this state,
and experienced enormous difficulties in subduing him.
  Marius was made consul, in a phase of public indignation, to
end this discreditable war.  This he did by raising <i>paid
troops</i> and drilling them hard.  Jugurtha was brought in
chains to Rome (106 <small>B.C.</small>) and Marius,
when his time of office had expired, held on to his
consulship illegally with his newly created legions.  There
was no power in Rome to restrain him.
</p>

<p>
With Marius began the third phase in the development of the
Roman power, the Republic of the Military Commanders.  For
now began a period in which the leaders of the paid legions
fought for the mastery of the Roman world.  Against Marius
was pitted the aristocratic Sulla who had served under him in
Africa.  Each in turn made a great massacre of his political
opponents.  Men were proscribed and executed by the thousand,
and their estates were sold.  After the bloody rivalry of
these two and the horror of the revolt of Spartacus, came a
phase in which Lucullus and Pompey the Great and Crassus and
Julius C&#230;sar were the masters of armies and dominated
affairs.  It was Crassus who defeated Spartacus.  Lucullus
conquered Asia Minor and penetrated to Armenia, and retired
with great wealth into private life.  Crassus thrusting
further invaded Persia and was defeated and slain by the
Parthians.  After a long rivalry Pompey was defeated by
Julius C&#230;sar (48 <small>B.C.</small>) and
murdered in Egypt, leaving Julius C&#230;sar sole master of
the Roman world.
</p>

<p>
The figure of Julius C&#230;sar is one that has stirred the
human imagination out of all proportion to its merit or true
importance.  He has become a legend and a symbol.  For us he
is chiefly important as marking the transition from the phase
of military adventurers to the beginning of the fourth stage
in Roman expansion, the Early Empire.  For in spite of the
profoundest economic and political convulsions, in spite of
civil war and social degeneration, throughout all this time
the boundaries of the Roman state crept outward and continued
to creep outward to their maximum about 100
 <small>A.D.</small>  There had been something like an ebb during
the doubtful phases of the Second Punic War, and again a
manifest loss of vigour before the reconstruction of the army
by Marius. The revolt of Spartacus <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P193"></a>193}</span>marked a third phase.  Julius
C&#230;sar made his reputation as a military leader in Gaul,
which is now France and Belgium.  (The chief tribes
inhabiting this country belonged to the same Celtic people as
the Gauls who had occupied north Italy for a time, and who
had afterwards raided into Asia Minor and settled down as the
Galatians.)  C&#230;sar drove back a German invasion of Gaul
and added all that country to the empire, and he twice
crossed the Straits of Dover into Britain (55 and 54
 <small>B.C.</small>), where however he made no permanent
conquest.  Meanwhile Pompey the Great was consolidating Roman
conquests that reached in the east to the Caspian Sea.

<p>
At this time, the middle of the first century
 <small>B.C.</small>, the Roman Senate was still the nominal
centre of the Roman government, appointing consuls and other
officials, granting powers and the like; and a number of
politicians, among whom Cicero was an outstanding <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P194"></a>194}</span>figure, were
struggling to preserve the great traditions of republican
Rome and to maintain respect for its laws.  But the spirit of
citizenship had gone from Italy with the wasting away of the
free farmers; it was a land now of slaves and impoverished
men with neither the understanding nor the desire for
freedom.  There was nothing whatever behind these republican
leaders in the Senate, while behind the great adventurers
they feared and desired to control were the legions.  Over
the heads of the Senate Crassus and Pompey and C&#230;sar
divided the rule of the Empire between them (The First
Triumvirate).  When presently Crassus was killed at distant
Carrh&#230; by the Parthians, Pompey and C&#230;sar fell out.
  Pompey took up the republican side, and laws were passed to
bring C&#230;sar to trial for his breaches of law and his
disobedience to the decrees of the Senate.
</p>

<p>
It was illegal for a general to bring his troops out of the
boundary of his command, and the boundary between
C&#230;sar&rsquo;s command and Italy was the Rubicon.  In 49
<small>B.C.</small> he crossed the Rubicon, saying
&ldquo;The die is cast&rdquo; and marched upon Pompey and
Rome.
</p>

<p>
It had been the custom in Rome in the past, in periods of
military extremity, to elect a &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; with
practically unlimited powers to rule through the crisis.
  After his overthrow of Pompey, C&#230;sar was made dictator
first for ten years and then (in 45
 <small>B.C.</small>) for life.  In effect he was made monarch of
the empire for life.  There was talk of a king, a word
abhorrent to Rome since the expulsion of the Etruscans five
centuries before.  C&#230;sar refused to be king, but adopted
throne and sceptre.  After his defeat of Pompey, C&#230;sar
had gone on into Egypt and had made love to Cleopatra, the
last of the Ptolemies, the goddess queen of Egypt.  She seems
to have turned his head very completely.  He had brought back
to Rome the Egyptian idea of a god-king.  His statue was set
up in a temple with an inscription &ldquo;To the
Unconquerable God.&rdquo;  The expiring republicanism of Rome
flared up in a last protest, and C&#230;sar was stabbed to
death in the Senate at the foot of the statue of his murdered
rival, Pompey the Great.
</p>

<p>
Thirteen years more of this conflict of ambitious
personalities followed.  There was a second Triumvirate of
Lepidus, Mark Antony and Octavian C&#230;sar, the latter the
nephew of Julius C&#230;sar.  Octavian like his uncle took
the poorer, hardier western provinces <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P195"></a>195}</span>where the best
legions were recruited.  In 31 <small>B.C.</small>,
he defeated Mark Antony, his only serious rival, at the naval
battle of Actium, and made himself sole master of the Roman
world.  But Octavian was a man of different quality
altogether from Julius C&#230;sar.  He had no foolish craving
to be God or King.  He had no queen-lover that he wished to
dazzle.  He restored freedom to the Senate and people of
Rome.  He declined to be dictator.  The grateful Senate in
return gave him the reality instead of the forms of power.
  He was to be called not King indeed, but
&ldquo;Princeps&rdquo; and &ldquo;Augustus.&rdquo;  He became
Augustus C&#230;sar, the first of the Roman emperors (27
<small>B.C.</small> to 14 <small>A.D.</small>).
</p>

<p>
He was followed by Tiberius C&#230;sar (14 to 37
<small>A.D.</small>) and he by others, Caligula, Claudius, Nero
and so on up to Trajan (98 <small>A.D.</small>),
Hadrian (117 <small>A.D.</small>), Antonius Pius
(138 <small>A.D.</small>) and Marcus Aurelius (161-
180 <small>A.D.</small>).  All these emperors were
emperors of the legions.  The soldiers made them, and some
the soldiers destroyed.  Gradually the Senate fades out of
Roman-history, and the emperor and his administrative
officials replace it.  The boundaries of the empire crept
forward now to their utmost limits.  Most of Britain was
added to the empire, Transylvania was brought in as a new
province, Dacia; Trajan crossed the Euphrates.  Hadrian had
an idea that reminds us at once of what had happened at the
other end of the old world.  Like Shi-Hwang-ti he built walls
against the northern barbarians; one across Britain and a
palisade between the Rhine and the Danube.  He abandoned some
of the acquisitions of Trajan.
</p>

<p>
The expansion of the Roman Empire was at an end.

<h4 align="center">BETWEEN ROME AND CHINA</h4>

<p>

THE second and first centuries <small>B.C.</small>
mark a new phase in the history of mankind.  Mesopotamia and
the eastern Mediterranean are no longer the centre of
interest.  Both Mesopotamia and Egypt were still fertile,
populous and fairly prosperous, but they were no longer the
dominant regions of the world.  Power had drifted to the west
and to the east.  Two great empires now dominated the world,
this new Roman Empire and the renascent Empire of China.
  Rome extended its power to the Euphrates, but it was never
able to get beyond that boundary.  It was too remote.  Beyond
the Euphrates the former Persian and Indian dominions of the
Seleucids fell under a number of new masters.  China, now
under the Han dynasty, which had replaced the Ts&rsquo;in
dynasty at the death of Shi-Hwang-ti, had extended its power
across Tibet and over the high mountain passes of the Pamirs
into western Turkestan.  But there, too, it reached its
extremes.  Beyond was too far.
</p>

<p>
China at this time was the greatest, best organized and most
civilized political system in the world.  It was superior in
area and population to the Roman Empire at its zenith.  It
was possible then for these two vast systems to flourish in
the same world at the same time in almost complete ignorance
of each other.  The means of communication both by sea and
land was not yet sufficiently developed and organized for
them to come to a direct clash.
</p>

<p>
Yet they reacted upon each other in a very remarkable way,
and their influence upon the fate of the regions that lay
between them, upon central Asia and India, was profound.  A
certain amount of trade trickled through, by camel caravans
across Persia, for example, and by coasting ships by way of
India and the Red Sea.  In 66 <small>B.C.</small>
Roman troops under Pompey followed in the footsteps of
Alexander the Great, and marched up the eastern shores of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P197"></a>197}</span>Caspian
Sea.  In 102 <small>A.D.</small> a Chinese
expeditionary force under Pan Chau reached the Caspian, and
sent emissaries to report upon the power of Rome.  But many
centuries were still to pass before definite knowledge and
direct intercourse were to link the great parallel worlds of
Europe and Eastern Asia.
</p>

<p>
To the north of both these great empires were barbaric
wildernesses.  What is now Germany was largely forest lands;
the forests extended far into Russia and made a home for the
gigantic aurochs, a bull of almost elephantine size.  Then to
the north of the great mountain masses of Asia stretched a
band of deserts, steppes and then forests and frozen lands.
  In the eastward lap of the elevated part of Asia was the
great triangle of Manchuria.  Large parts of these regions,
stretching between South Russia and Turkestan into Manchuria,
were and are regions of exceptional climatic insecurity.
  Their rainfall has varied greatly in the course of a few
centuries  They are lands treacherous to man.  For years they
will carry pasture and sustain cultivation, and then will
come an age of decline in humidity and a cycle of killing
droughts.

<p>
The western part of this barbaric north from the German
forests to South Russia and Turkestan and from Gothland to
the Alps was the region of origin of the Nordic peoples and
of the Aryan speech.  The eastern steppes and deserts of
Mongolia was the region of origin of the Hunnish or Mongolian
or Tartar or Turkish peoples&#8212;for all these several
peoples were akin in language, race, and way of life.  And as
the Nordic peoples seem to have been continually overflowing
their own borders and pressing south upon the developing
civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean coast, so
the Hunnish <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P198"></a>198}</span>tribes sent their surplus as
wanderers, raiders and conquerors into the settled regions of
China.  Periods of plenty in the north would mean an increase
in population there; a shortage of grass, a spell of cattle
disease, would drive the hungry warlike tribesmen south.
</p>

<p>
For a time there were simultaneously two fairly effective
Empires in the world capable of holding back the barbarians
and even forcing forward the frontiers of the imperial peace.
  The thrust of the Han empire from north China into Mongolia
was strong and continuous.  The Chinese population welled up
over the barrier of the Great Wall.  Behind the imperial
frontier guards came the Chinese farmer with horse and
plough, ploughing up the grass lands and enclosing the winter
pasture.  The Hunnish peoples raided and murdered the
settlers, but the Chinese punitive expeditions were too much
for them.  The nomads were faced with the choice of settling
down to the plough and becoming Chinese tax-payers or
shifting in search of fresh summer pastures.  Some took the
former course and were absorbed.  Some drifted north-eastward
and eastward over the mountain passes down into western
Turkestan.

This westward drive of the Mongolian horsemen was going on

producing a westward pressure upon the Aryan tribes, and
these again were pressing upon the Roman frontiers ready to
break through directly there was any weakness apparent.  The

But for a time the line of least resistance for hungry nomads
lay neither to the west nor the east but through central Asia
and then south-eastward through the Khyber Pass into India.
  It was India which received the Mongolian drive in these
centuries of Roman and Chinese strength.  A series of raiding
conquerors poured down through the Punjab into the great
plains to loot and destroy.  The empire of Asoka was broken
up, and for a time the history of India passes into darkness.
  A certain Kushan dynasty founded by the &ldquo;Indo-
Scythians&rdquo;&#8212;one of the raiding peoples&#8212;ruled
for a time over North India and maintained a certain order.
  These invasions went on for several centuries.  For a large
part of the fifth century <small>A.D.</small> India
was afflicted by the Ephthalites or White Huns, who levied
tribute on the small Indian princes and held India in terror.
  Every summer these Ephthalites pastured in western Turkestan,
every autumn they came down through the passes to terrorize
India.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P200"></a>200}</span>In the
second century <small>A.D.</small> a great
misfortune came upon the Roman and Chinese empires that
probably weakened the resistance of both to barbarian
pressure.  This was a pestilence of unexampled virulence.  It
raged for eleven years in China and disorganized the social
framework profoundly.  The Han dynasty fell, and a new age of
division and confusion began from which China did not fairly
recover until the seventh century
 <small>A.D.</small> with the coming of the great Tang dynasty.
</p>

<p>
The infection spread through Asia to Europe.  It raged
throughout the Roman Empire from 164 to 180
 <small>A.D.</small>  It evidently weakened the Roman imperial
fabric very seriously.  We begin to hear of depopulation in
the Roman provinces after this, and there was a marked
deterioration in the vigour and efficiency of government.  At
any rate we presently find the frontier no longer
invulnerable, but giving way first in this place and then in
that.  A new Nordic people, the Goths, coming originally from
Gothland in Sweden, had migrated across Russia to the Volga
region and the shores of the Black Sea and taken to the sea
and piracy.  By the end of the second century they may have
begun to feel the westward thrust of the Huns.  In 247 they
crossed the Danube in a great land raid, and defeated and
killed the Emperor Decius in a battle in what is now Serbia.
  In 236 another Germanic people, the Franks, had broken bounds
upon the lower Rhine, and the Alemanni had poured into
Alsace.  The legions in Gaul beat back their invaders, but
the Goths in the Balkan peninsula raided again and again.
  The province of Dacia vanished from Roman history.
</p>

<p>
A chill had come to the pride and confidence of Rome.  In
270-275 Rome, which had been an open and secure city for
three centuries, was fortified by the Emperor Aurelian.

<h4 align="center">THE COMMON MAN&rsquo;S LIFE UNDER THE
EARLY ROMAN EMPIRE</h4>

<p>

BEFORE we tell of how this Roman empire which was built up in
the two centuries <small>B.C.</small>, and which
flourished in peace and security from the days of Augustus
C&#230;sar onward for two centuries, fell into disorder and
was broken up, it may be as well to devote some attention to
the life of the ordinary people throughout this great realm.
  Our history has come down now to within 2000 years of our own
time; and the life of the civilized people, both under the
Peace of Rome and the Peace of the Han dynasty, was beginning
to resemble more and more clearly the life of their civilized
successors to-day.
</p>

<p>
In the western world coined money was now in common use;
outside the priestly world there were many people of
independent means who were neither officials of the
government nor priests; people travelled about more freely
than they had ever done before, and there were high roads and
inns for them.  Compared with the past, with the time before
500 <small>B.C.</small>, life had become much more
loose.  Before that date civilized men had been bound to a
district or country, had been bound to a tradition and lived
within a very limited horizon; only the nomads traded and
travelled.
</p>

<p>
But neither the Roman Peace nor the Peace of the Han dynasty
meant a uniform civilization over the large areas they
controlled.  There were very great local differences and
great contrasts and inequalities of culture between one
district and another, just as there are to-day under the
British Peace in India.  The Roman garrisons and colonies
were dotted here and there over this great space, worshipping
Roman gods and speaking the Latin language; but where there
had been towns and cities before the coming of the Romans,
they went on, subordinated indeed but managing their own
affairs, and, for a time at least, worshipping their own gods
in their own fashion.  Over Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt and the
Hellenized East <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P202"></a>202}</span>generally, the Latin language
never prevailed.  Greek ruled there invincibly.  Saul of
Tarsus, who became the apostle Paul, was a Jew and a Roman
citizen; but he spoke and wrote Greek and not Hebrew.  Even
at the court of the Parthian dynasty, which had overthrown
the Greek Seleucids in Persia, and was quite outside the
Roman imperial boundaries, Greek was the fashionable
language.  In some parts of Spain and in North Africa, the
Carthaginian language also held on for a long time in spite
of the destruction of Carthage.  Such a town as Seville,
which had been a prosperous city long before the Roman name
had been heard of, kept its Semitic goddess and preserved its
Semitic speech for generations, in spite of a colony of Roman
veterans at Italica a few miles away.  Septimius Severus, who
was emperor from 193 to 211 <small>A.D.</small>,
spoke Carthaginian as his mother speech.  He learnt Latin
later as a foreign tongue; <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P203"></a>203}</span>and it is recorded that his sister
never learnt Latin and conducted her Roman household in the
Punic language.

<p>
In such countries as Gaul and Britain and in provinces like
Dacia (now roughly Roumania) and Pannonia (Hungary south of
the Danube), where there were no pre-existing great cities
and temples and cultures, the Roman empire did however
&ldquo;Latinize.&rdquo;  It civilized these countries for the
first time.  It created cities and towns where Latin was from
the first the dominant speech, and where Roman gods were
served and Roman customs and fashions followed.  The
Roumanian, Italian, French and Spanish languages, all
variations and modifications of Latin, remain to remind us of
this extension of Latin speech and customs.  North-west
Africa also became at last largely Latin-speaking.  Egypt,
Greece and the rest of the empire to the east were never
Latinized.  They remained Egyptian and Greek in culture and
spirit.  And even in Rome, among educated men, Greek was
learnt as the language of a gentleman and Greek literature
and learning were very, properly preferred to Latin.
</p>

<p>
In this miscellaneous empire the ways of doing work and
business were naturally also very miscellaneous.  The chief
industry of the settled world was still largely agriculture.
  We have told how in Italy the sturdy free farmers who were
the backbone of the early Roman republic were replaced by
estates worked by slave labour after the Punic wars.  The
Greek world had had very various methods of cultivation, from
the Arcadian plan, wherein every free citizen toiled with his
own hands, to Sparta, wherein it was a dishonour to work and
where agricultural work was done by a special slave class,
the Helots.  But that was ancient history now, and over most
of the Hellenized world the estate system and slave-gangs had
spread.  The agricultural slaves were captives who spoke many
different languages so that they could not understand each
other, or they were born slaves; they had no solidarity to
resist oppression, no tradition of rights, no knowledge, for
they could not read nor write.  Although they came to form a
majority of the country population they never made a
successful insurrection.  The insurrection of Spartacus in
the first century <small>B.C.</small> was an
insurrection of the special slaves who were trained for the
gladiatorial combats. The agricultural workers in Italy in
the latter days of <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P204"></a>204}</span>the Republic and the early Empire
suffered frightful indignities; they would be chained at
night to prevent escape or have half the head shaved to make
it difficult.  They had no wives of their own; they could be
outraged, mutilated and killed by their masters.  A master
could sell his slave to fight beasts in the arena.  If a
slave slew his master, all the slaves in his household and
not merely the murderer were crucified.  In some parts of
Greece, in Athens notably, the lot of the slave was never
quite so frightful as this, but it was still detestable.  To
such a population the barbarian invaders who presently broke
through the defensive line of the legions, came not as
enemies but as liberators.

<p>
The slave system had spread to most industries and to every
sort of work that could be done by gangs.  Mines and
metallurgical operations, the rowing of galleys, road-making
and big building operations were all largely slave
occupations.  And almost all domestic service was performed
by slaves.  There were poor free-men <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P205"></a>205}</span>and there were
freed-men in the cities and upon the country side, working
for themselves or even working for wages.  They were
artizans, supervisors and so forth, workers of a new money-
paid class working in competition with slave workers; but we
do not know what proportion they made of the general
population.  It probably varied widely in different places
and at different periods.  And there were also many
modifications of slavery, from the slavery that was chained
at night and driven with whips to the farm or quarry, to the
slave whose master found it advantageous to leave him to
cultivate his patch or work his craft and own his wife like a
free-man, provided he paid in a satisfactory quittance to his
owner.
</p>

<p>
There were armed slaves.  At the opening of the period of the
Punic wars, in 264 <small>B.C.</small>, the Etruscan
sport of setting slaves to fight for their lives was revived
in Rome.  It grew rapidly fashionable; and soon every great
Roman rich man kept a retinue of gladiators, who sometimes
fought in the arena but whose real business it was to act as
his bodyguard of bullies.  And also there were learned
slaves.  The conquests of the later Republic were among the
highly civilized cities of Greece, North Africa and Asia
Minor; and they brought in many highly educated captives.
  The tutor of a young Roman of good family was usually a
slave.  A rich man would have a Greek slave as librarian, and
slave secretaries and learned men.  He would keep his poet as
he would keep a performing dog.  In this atmosphere of
slavery the traditions of modern literary criticism were
evolved.  The slaves still boast and quarrel in our reviews.
  There were enterprising people who bought intelligent boy
slaves and had them educated for sale.  Slaves were trained
as book copyists, as jewellers, and for endless skilled
callings.

<p>
But there were very considerable changes in the position of a
slave during the four hundred years between the opening days
of conquest under the republic of rich men and the days of
disintegration that followed the great pestilence.  In the
second century <small>B.C.</small> war-captives were
abundant, manners gross and brutal; the slave had no rights
and there was scarcely an outrage the reader can imagine that
was not practised upon slaves in those days.  But already in
the first century <small>A.D.</small> there was a
perceptible improvement in the attitude of the Roman
civilization towards slavery.  Captives <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P207"></a>207}</span>were not so
abundant for one thing, and slaves were dearer.  And slave-
owners began to realize that the profit and comfort they got
from their slaves increased with the self-respect of these
unfortunates.  But also the moral tone of the community was
rising, and a sense of justice was becoming effective.  The
higher mentality of Greece was qualifying the old Roman
harshness.  Restrictions upon cruelty were made, a master
might no longer sell his slave to fight beasts, a slave was
given property rights in what was called his <i>peculium</i>,
slaves were paid wages as an encouragement and stimulus, a
form of slave marriage was recognized.  Very many forms of
agriculture do not lend themselves to gang working, or
require gang workers only at certain seasons.  In regions
where such conditions prevailed the slave presently became a
serf, paying his owner part of his produce or working for him
at certain seasons.
</p>

<p>
When we begin to realize how essentially this great Latin and
Greek-speaking Roman Empire of the first two centuries
 <small>A.D.</small> was a slave state and how small was
the minority who had any pride or freedom in their lives, we
lay our hands on the clues to its decay and collapse.  There
was little of what we should call family life, few homes of
temperate living and active thought and study; schools and
colleges were few and far between.  The free will and the
free mind were nowhere to be found.  The great roads, the
ruins of splendid buildings, the tradition of law and power
it left for the astonishment of succeeding generations must
not conceal from us that all its outer splendour was built
upon thwarted wills, stifled intelligence, and crippled and
perverted desires.  And even the minority who lorded it over
that wide realm of subjugation and of restraint and forced
labour were uneasy and unhappy in their souls; art and
literature, science and philosophy, which are the fruits of
free and happy minds, waned in that atmosphere.  There was
much copying and imitation, an abundance of artistic
artificers, much slavish pedantry among the servile men of
learning, but the whole Roman empire in four centuries
produced nothing to set beside the bold and noble
intellectual activities of the comparatively little city of
Athens during its one century of greatness.  Athens decayed
under the Roman sceptre.  The science of Alexandria decayed.
  The spirit of man, it seemed, was decaying in those days.

<h4 align="center">RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENTS UNDER THE ROMAN
EMPIRE</h4>

<p>

THE soul of man under that Latin and Greek empire of the
first two centuries of the Christian era was a worried and
frustrated soul.  Compulsion and cruelty reigned; there were
pride and display but little honour; little serenity or
steadfast happiness.  The unfortunate were despised and
wretched; the fortunate were insecure and feverishly eager
for gratifications.  In a great number of cities life centred
on the red excitement of the arena, where men and beasts
fought and were tormented and slain.  Amphitheatres are the
most characteristic of Roman ruins.  Life went on in that
key.  The uneasiness of men&rsquo;s hearts manifested itself
in profound religious unrest.
</p>

<p>
From the days when the Aryan hordes first broke in upon the
ancient civilizations, it was inevitable that the old gods of
the temples and priesthoods should suffer great adaptations
or disappear.  In the course of hundreds of generations the
agricultural peoples of the brunette civilizations had shaped
their lives and thoughts to the temple-centred life.
  Observances and the fear of disturbed routines, sacrifices
and mysteries, dominated their minds.  Their gods seem
monstrous and illogical to our modern minds because we belong
to an Aryanized world, but to these older peoples these
deities had the immediate conviction and vividness of things
seen in an intense dream.  The conquest of one city state by
another in Sumeria or early Egypt meant a change or a
renaming of gods or goddesses, but left the shape and spirit
of the worship intact.  There was no change in its general
character.  The figures in the dream changed, but the dream
went on and it was the same sort of dream.  And the early
Semitic conquerors were sufficiently akin in spirit to the
Sumerians to take over the religion of the Mesopotamian
civilization they subjugated without any profound alteration.
  Egypt was never <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P209"></a>209}</span>indeed subjugated to the extent of
a religious revolution.  Under the Ptolemies and under the
C&#230;sars, her temples and altars and priesthoods remained
essentially Egyptian.
</p>

<p>
So long as conquests went on between people of similar social
and religious habits it was possible to get over the clash
between the god of this temple and region and the god of that
by a process of grouping or assimilation.  If the two gods
were alike in character they were identified.  It was really
the same god under another name, said the priests and the
people.  This fusion of gods is called theocrasia; and the
age of the great conquests of the thousand years
 <small>B.C.</small> was an age of theocrasia.  Over wide areas
the local gods were displaced by, or rather they were
swallowed up in, a general god.  So that when at last Hebrew
prophets in Babylon proclaimed one God of Righteousness in
all the earth men&rsquo;s minds were fully prepared for that
idea.
</p>

<p>
But often the gods were too dissimilar for such an
assimilation, and then they were grouped together in some
plausible relationship.  A female god - and the &#198;gean
world before the coming of the Greek was much addicted to
Mother Gods&#8212;would be married to a male god, and an
animal god or a star god would be humanized and the animal or
astronomical aspect, the serpent or the sun or the star, made
into an ornament or a symbol.  Or the god of a defeated
people would become a malignant antagonist to the brighter
gods.  The history of theology is full of such adaptations,
compromises and rationalizations of once local gods.
</p>

<p>
As Egypt developed from city states into one united kingdom
there was much of this theocrasia.  The chief god so to speak
was Osiris, a sacrificial harvest god of whom Pharaoh was
supposed to be the earthly incarnation.  Osiris was
represented as repeatedly dying and rising again; he was not
only the seed and the harvest but also by a natural extension
of thought the means of human immortality.  Among his symbols
was the wide-winged scarabeus beetle which buries its eggs to
rise again, and also the effulgent sun which sets to rise.
  Later on he was to be identified with Apis, the sacred bull.
  Associated with him was the goddess Isis.  Isis was also
Hathor, a cow-goddess, and the crescent moon and the Star of
the sea.  Osiris dies and she bears a child, Horus, who is
also a <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P210"></a>210}</span>hawk-god and the dawn, and who
grows to become Osiris again.  The effigies of Isis represent
her as bearing the infant Horus in her arms and standing on
the crescent moon.  These are not logical relationships, but
they were devised by the human mind before the development of
hard and systematic thinking and they have a dream-like
coherence.  Beneath this triple group there are other and
darker Egyptian gods, bad gods, the dog-headed Anubis, black
night and the like, devourers, tempters, enemies of god and
man.

<p>
Every religious system does in the course of time fit itself
to the shape of the human soul, and there can be no doubt
that out of these illogical and even uncouth symbols,
Egyptian people were able to fashion for themselves ways of
genuine devotion and consolation.  The desire for immortality
was very strong in the Egyptian mind, and the religious life
of Egypt turned on that desire. The Egyptian <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P211"></a>211}</span>religion was
an immortality religion as no other religion had ever been.
  As Egypt went down under foreign conquerors and the Egyptian
gods ceased to have any satisfactory political significance,
this craving for a life of compensations here-after,
intensified.

</center>


<p>
After the Greek conquest, the new city of Alexandria became
the centre of Egyptian religious life, and indeed of the
religious life of the whole Hellenic world.  A great temple,
the Serapeum, was set up by Ptolemy I at which a sort of
trinity of gods was worshipped. These were Serapis (who was
Osiris-Apis rechristened), Isis and Horus. These were not
regarded as separate gods but as three aspects of one god,
and Serapis was identified with the Greek Zeus, the Roman
Jupiter and the Persian sun-god.  This worship spread
wherever the Hellenic influence extended, even into North
India and Western China.  The idea of immortality, an
immortality of compensations and consolation, was eagerly
received by a world in which the common life was hopelessly
wretched.  Serapis was called &ldquo;the saviour of
souls.&rdquo;  &ldquo;After death,&rdquo; said the hymns of
that time, &ldquo;we are still in the care of his
providence.&rdquo;  Isis attracted many devotees.  Her images
stood in her temples, as Queen of Heaven, bearing the infant
Horus in her arms.  Candles were burnt before her, votive
offerings were made to her, shaven priests consecrated to
celibacy waited on her altar.
</p>

<p>
The rise of the Roman empire opened the western European
world to this growing cult.  The temples of Serapis-Isis, the
chanting of the priests and the hope of immortal life,
followed the Roman standards to Scotland and Holland.  But
there were many rivals to the Serapis-Isis religion.
  Prominent among these was Mithraism.  This was a religion of
Persian origin, and it centred upon some now forgotten
mysteries about Mithras sacrificing a sacred and benevolent
bull.  Here we seem to have something more primordial <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P212"></a>212}</span>than the
complicated and sophisticated Serapis-Isis beliefs.  We are
carried back directly to the blood sacrifices of the
heliolithic stage in human culture.  The bull upon the
Mithraic monuments always bleeds copiously from a wound in
its side, and from this blood springs new life.  The votary
to Mithraism actually bathed in the blood of the sacrificial
bull.  At his initiation he went beneath a scaffolding upon
which a bull was killed so that the blood could actually run
down on him.
</p>

<p>
Both these religions, and the same is true of many other of
the numerous parallel cults that sought the allegiance of the
slaves and citizens under the earlier Roman emperors, are
personal religions.  They aim at personal salvation and
personal immortality.  The older religions were not personal
like that; they were social.  The older fashion of divinity
was god or goddess of the city first or of the state, and
only secondarily of the individual.  The sacrifices were a
public and not a private function.  They concerned collective
practical needs in this world in which we live.  But the
Greeks first and now the Romans had pushed religion out of
politics.  Guided by the Egyptian tradition religion had
retreated to the other world.

<p>
These new private immortality religions took all the heart
and emotion out of the old state religions, but they did not
actually replace them.  A typical city under the earlier
Roman emperors would have a number of temples to all sorts of
gods.  There might be a temple to Jupiter of the Capitol, the
great god of Rome, and there would probably be one to the
reigning C&#230;sar.  For the C&#230;sars had learnt from the
Pharaohs the possibility of being gods.  In such temples a
cold and stately political worship went on; one would go and
make an offering and burn a pinch of incense to show
one&rsquo;s loyalty.  But it would be to the temple of Isis,
the dear Queen of Heaven, one would go with the burthen <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P213"></a>213}</span>of one&rsquo;s
private troubles for advice and relief.  There might be local
and eccentric gods.  Seville, for example, long affected the
worship of the old Carthaginian Venus.  In a cave or an
underground temple there would certainly be an altar to
Mithras, attended by legionaries and slaves.  And probably
also there would be a synagogue where the Jews gathered to
read their Bible and uphold their faith in the unseen God of
all the Earth.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes there would be trouble with the Jews about the
political side of the state religion.  They held that their
God was a jealous God intolerant of idolatry, and they would
refuse to take part in the public sacrifices to C&#230;sar.
  They would not even salute the Roman standards for fear of
idolatry.
</p>

<p>
In the East long before the time of Buddha there had been
ascetics, men and women who gave up most of the delights of
life, who repudiated marriage and property and sought
spiritual powers and an escape from the stresses and
mortifications of the world in abstinence, pain and solitude.
  Buddha himself set his face against ascetic extravagances,
but many of his disciples followed a monkish life of great
severity.  Obscure Greek cults practised similar disciplines
even to the extent of self-mutilation.  Asceticism appeared
in the Jewish communities of Judea and Alexandria also in the
first century <small>B.C.</small>  Communities of
men abandoned the world and gave themselves to austerities
and mystical contemplation.  Such was the sect of the
Essenes.  Throughout the first and second centuries
 <small>A.D.</small> there was an almost world-wide resort
to such repudiations of life, a universal search for
&ldquo;salvation&rdquo; from the distresses of the time.  The
old sense of an established order, the old confidence in
priest and temple and law and custom, had gone.  Amidst the
prevailing slavery, cruelty, fear, anxiety, waste, display
and hectic self-indulgence, went this epidemic of self-
disgust and mental insecurity, this agonized search for peace
even at the price of renunciation and voluntary suffering.
  This it was that filled the Serapeum with weeping penitents
and brought the converts into the gloom and gore of the
Mithraic cave.

<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P214"></a>214}</span><a

<h4 align="center">THE TEACHING OF JESUS</h4>

<p>

IT was while Augustus C&#230;sar, the first of the Emperors,
was reigning in Rome that Jesus who is the Christ of
Christianity was born in Judea.  In his name a religion was
to arise which was destined to become the official religion
of the entire Roman Empire.
</p>

<p>
Now it is on the whole more convenient to keep history and
theology apart.  A large proportion of the Christian world
believes that Jesus was an incarnation of that God of all the
Earth whom the Jews first recognized.  The historian, if he
is to remain historian, can neither accept nor deny that
interpretation.  Materially Jesus appeared in the likeness of
a man, and it is as a man that the historian must deal with
him.
</p>

<p>
He appeared in Judea in the reign of Tiberius C&#230;sar.  He
was a prophet.  He preached after the fashion of the
preceding Jewish prophets.  He was a man of about thirty, and
we are in the profoundest ignorance of his manner of life
before his preaching began.
</p>

<p>
Our only direct sources of information about the life and
teaching of Jesus are the four Gospels.  All four agree in
giving us a picture of a very definite personality.  One is
obliged to say, &ldquo;Here was a man.  This could not have
been invented.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But just as the personality of Gautama Buddha has been
distorted and obscured by the stiff squatting figure, the
gilded idol of later Buddhism, so one feels that the lean and
strenuous personality of Jesus is much wronged by the
unreality and conventionality that a mistaken reverence has
imposed upon his figure in modern Christian art.  Jesus was a
penniless teacher, who wandered about the dusty sun-bit
country of Judea, living upon casual gifts of food; yet he is
always represented clean, combed and sleek, in spotless
raiment, erect and with something motionless about him as
though <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P215"></a>215}</span>he was gliding through the air.
  This alone has made him unreal and incredible to many people
who cannot distinguish the core of the story from the
ornamental and unwise additions of the unintelligently
devout.
</p>

<p>
We are left, if we do strip this record of these difficult
accessories, with the figure of a being, very human, very
earnest and passionate, capable of swift anger, and teaching
a new and simple and profound doctrine&#8212;namely, the
universal loving Fatherhood of God and the coming of the
Kingdom of Heaven.  He was clearly a person&#8212;to use a
common phrase&#8212;of intense personal magnetism.  He
attracted followers and filled them with love and courage.
  Weak and ailing people were heartened and healed by his
presence.  Yet he was probably of a delicate physique,
because of the swiftness with which he died under the pains
of crucifixion.  There is a tradition that he fainted when,
according to the custom, he was made to bear his cross to the
place of execution.  He went about the country for three
years spreading his doctrine and then he came to Jerusalem
and was accused of trying to set up a strange kingdom in
Judea; he was tried upon this charge, and crucified together
with two thieves.  Long before these two were dead his
sufferings were over.
</p>

<p>
The doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was the main
teaching of Jesus, is certainly one of the most revolutionary
doctrines that ever stirred and changed human thought.  It is
small wonder if the world of that time failed to grasp its
full significance, and recoiled in dismay from even a half
apprehension of its tremendous challenges to the established
habits and institutions of mankind.  For the doctrine of the
Kingdom of Heaven, as Jesus seems to have preached it, was no
less than a bold and uncompromising demand for a complete
change and cleansing of the life of our struggling race, an
utter cleansing, without and within.  To the gospels the
reader must go for all that is preserved of this tremendous
teaching; here we are only concerned with the jar of its
impact upon established ideas.
</p>

<p>
The Jews were persuaded that God, the one God of the whole
world, was a righteous god, but they also thought of him as a
trading god who had made a bargain with their Father Abraham
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P216"></a>216}</span>about
them, a very good bargain indeed for them, to bring them at
last to predominance in the earth. With dismay and anger they
heard Jesus sweeping away their dear securities.  God, he
taught, was no bargainer; there were no chosen people and no
favourites in the Kingdom of Heaven.  God was the loving
father of all life, as incapable of showing favour as the
universal sun.  And all men were brothers&#8212;sinners alike
and beloved sons alike&#8212;of this divine father.  In the
parable of the Good Samaritan Jesus cast scorn upon that
natural tendency we all obey, to glorify our own people and
to minimize the righteousness of other creeds and other
races.  In the parable of the labourers he thrust aside the
obstinate claim of the Jews to have a special claim upon God.
  All whom God takes into the kingdom, he taught, God serves
alike; there is no distinction in his treatment, because
there is no measure to his bounty.  From all moreover, as the
parable of the buried talent witnesses, and as the incident
of the widow&rsquo;s mite enforces, he demands the utmost.
  There are no privileges, no rebates and no excuses in the
Kingdom of Heaven.

<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P217"></a>217}</span>But it
is not only the intense tribal patriotism of the Jews that
Jesus outraged.  They were a people of intense family
loyalty, and he would have swept away all the narrow and
restrictive family affections in the great flood of the love
of God.  The whole kingdom of Heaven was to be the family of
his followers.  We are told that, &ldquo;While he yet talked
to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood
without, desiring to speak with him.  Then one said unto him,
Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring
to speak with thee.  But he answered and said unto him that
told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he
stretched forth his hands towards his disciples, and said,
Behold my mother and my brethren!  For whosoever shall do the
will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother,
and sister, and mother.?  [<a name="chapXXXVIIfn1text"></a><a

And not only did Jesus strike at patriotism and the bonds of
family loyalty in the name of God&rsquo;s universal
fatherhood and brotherhood of all mankind, but it is clear
that his teaching condemned all the gradations of the
economic system, all private wealth, and <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P218"></a>218}</span>personal
advantages.  All men belonged to the kingdom; all their
possessions belonged to the kingdom; the righteous life for
all men, the only righteous life, was the service of
God&rsquo;s will with all that we had, with all that we were.
  Again and again he denounced private riches and the
reservation of any private life.

&ldquo;And when he was gone forth into the way, there came
one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master,
what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?  And Jesus
said to him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but
one, that is God.  Thou knowest the commandments, Do not
commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false
witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.  And he
answered and said unto him, Master, all these things have I
observed from my youth.  Then Jesus beholding him loved him,
and said unto him, One thing thou lackest; go thy way, sell
whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and
follow me.  And he was sad at that saying, and went away
grieved; for he had great possessions.

&ldquo;And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his
disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into
the Kingdom of God!  And the disciples were astonished at his
words.  But Jesus answered again, and saith unto them,
Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to
enter into the Kingdom of God!  It is <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P220"></a>220}</span>easier for a
camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man
to enter into the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;  [<a
name="chapXXXVIIfn2text"></a><a href="#chapXXXVIIfn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
Moreover, in his tremendous prophecy of this kingdom which
was to make all men one together in God, Jesus had small
patience for the bargaining righteousness of formal religion.
  Another large part of his recorded utterances is aimed
against the meticulous observance of the rules of the pious
career.  &ldquo;Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why
walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the
elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?  He answered and
said unto them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you
hypocrites, as it is written,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This people honoureth me with their lips,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But their heart is far from me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Howbeit in vain do they worship me,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the
tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many
other such things ye do.  And he said unto them, Full well ye
reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own
tradition.&rdquo;  [<a name="chapXXXVIIfn3text"></a><a
href="#chapXXXVIIfn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
It was not merely a moral and a social revolution that Jesus
proclaimed; it is clear from a score of indications that his
teaching had a political bent of the plainest sort.  It is
true that he said his kingdom was not of this world, that it
was in the hearts of men and not upon a throne; but it is
equally clear that wherever and in what measure his kingdom
was set up in the hearts of men, the outer world would be in
that measure revolutionized and made new.
</p>

<p>
Whatever else the deafness and blindness of his hearers may
have missed in his utterances, it is plain they did not miss
his resolve to revolutionize the world.  The whole tenor of
the opposition to him and the circumstances of his trial and
execution show clearly that to his contemporaries he seemed
to propose plainly, and did propose plainly, to change and
fuse and enlarge all human life.
</p>

<p>
In view of what he plainly said, is it any wonder that all
who were rich and prosperous felt a horror of strange things,
a swimming of their world at his teaching?  He was dragging
out all the little private reservations they had made from
social service into the light <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P221"></a>221}</span>of a universal religious life.  He
was like some terrible moral huntsman digging mankind out of
the snug burrows in which they had lived hitherto.  In the
white blaze of this kingdom of his there was to be no
property, no privilege, no pride and precedence; no motive
indeed and no reward but love.  Is it any wonder that men
were dazzled and blinded and cried out against him?  Even his
disciples cried out when he would not spare them the light.
  Is it any wonder that the priests realized that between this
man and themselves there was no choice but that he or
priestcraft should perish?  Is it any wonder that the Roman
soldiers, confronted and amazed by something soaring over
their comprehension and threatening all their disciplines,
should take refuge in wild laughter, and crown him with
thorns and robe him in purple and make a mock C&#230;sar of
him?  For to take him seriously was to enter upon a strange
and alarming life, to abandon habits, to control instincts
and impulses, to essay an incredible happiness. . . .

<h4 align="center">THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOCTRINAL
CHRISTIANITY</h4>

<p>

IN the four gospels we find the personality and teachings of
Jesus but very little of the dogmas of the Christian church.
  It is in the epistles, a series of writings by the immediate
followers of Jesus, that the broad lines of Christian belief
are laid down.
</p>

<p>
Chief among the makers of Christian doctrine was St. Paul.
  He had never seen Jesus nor heard him preach.  Paul&rsquo;s
name was originally Saul, and he was conspicuous at first as
an active persecutor of the little band of disciples after
the crucifixion.  Then he was suddenly converted to
Christianity, and he changed his name to Paul.  He was a man
of great intellectual vigour and deeply and passionately
interested in the religious movements of the time.  He was
well versed in Judaism and in the Mithraism and Alexandrian
religion of the day.  He carried over many of their ideas and
terms of expression into Christianity.  He did very little to
enlarge or develop the original teaching of Jesus, the
teaching of the Kingdom of Heaven.  But he taught that Jesus
was not only the promised Christ, the promised leader of the
Jews, but also that his death was a sacrifice, like the
deaths of the ancient sacrificial victims of the primordial
civilizations, for the redemption of mankind.
</p>

<p>
When religions flourish side by side they tend to pick up
each other&rsquo;s ceremonial and other outward
peculiarities.  Buddhism, for example, in China has now
almost the same sort of temples and priests and uses as
Taoism, which follows in the teachings of Lao Tse.  Yet the
original teachings of Buddhism and Taoism were almost flatly
opposed.  And it reflects no doubt or discredit upon the
essentials of Christian teaching that it took over not merely
such formal things as the shaven priest, the votive offering,
the altars, candles, chanting and images of the Alexandrian
and Mithraic faiths, but adopted even their devotional
phrases and their theological <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P223"></a>223}</span>ideas.  All these religions were
flourishing side by side with many less prominent cults.
  Each was seeking adherents, and there must have been a
constant going and coming of converts between them.
  Sometimes one or other would be in favour with the
government.  But Christianity was regarded with more
suspicion than its rivals because, like the Jews, its
adherents would not perform acts of worship to the God
C&#230;sar.  This made it a seditious religion, quite apart
from the revolutionary spirit of the teachings of Jesus
himself.

<p>
St. Paul familiarized his disciples with the idea that Jesus,
like <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P224"></a>224}</span>Osiris, was a god who died to rise
again and give men immortality.  And presently the spreading
Christian community was greatly torn by complicated
theological disputes about the relationship of this God Jesus
to God the Father of Mankind.  The Arians taught that Jesus
was divine, but distant from and inferior to the Father.  The
Sabellians taught that Jesus was merely an aspect of the
Father, and that God was Jesus and Father at the same time
just as a man may be a father and an artificer at the same
time; and the Trinitarians taught a more subtle doctrine that
God was both one and three, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  For
a time it seemed that Arianism would prevail over its rivals,
and then after disputes, violence and wars, the Trinitarian
formula became the accepted formula of all Christendom.  It
may be found in its completest expression in the Athanasian
Creed.
</p>

<p>
We offer no comment on these controversies here.  They do not
sway history as the personal teaching of Jesus sways history.
  The personal teaching of Jesus does seem to mark a new phase
in the moral and spiritual life of our race.  Its insistence
upon the universal Fatherhood of God and the implicit
brotherhood of all men, its insistence upon the sacredness of
every human personality as a living temple of God, was to
have the profoundest effect upon all the subsequent social
and political life of mankind.  With Christianity, with the
spreading teachings of Jesus, a new respect appears in the
world for man as man.  It may be true, as hostile critics of
Christianity have urged, that St.. Paul preached obedience to
slaves, but it is equally true that the whole spirit of the
teachings of Jesus preserved in the gospels was against the
subjugation of man by man.  And still more distinctly was
Christianity opposed to such outrages upon human dignity as
the gladiatorial combats in the arena.

<p>
Throughout the first two centuries after Christ, the
Christian religion spread throughout the Roman Empire,
weaving together an ever-growing multitude of converts into a
new community of ideas and will.  The attitude of the
emperors varied between hostility and toleration.  There were
attempts to suppress this new faith in both the second and
third centuries; and finally in 303 and the following years a
great persecution under the Emperor Diocletian.  The
considerable accumulations of Church property were <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P225"></a>225}</span>seized, all
bibles and religious writings were confiscated and destroyed,
Christians were put out of the protection of the law and many
executed.  The destruction of the books is particularly
notable.  It shows how the power of the written word in
holding together <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P226"></a>226}</span>the new faith was appreciated by
the authorities.  These &ldquo;book religions,&rdquo;
Christianity and Judaism, were religions that educated.
  Their continued existence depended very largely on people
being able to read and understand their doctrinal ideas.  The
older religions had made no such appeal to the personal
intelligence.  In the ages of barbaric confusion that were
now at hand in western Europe it was the Christian church
that was mainly instrumental in preserving the tradition of
learning.
</p>

<p>
The persecution of Diocletian failed completely to suppress
the growing Christian community.  In many provinces it was
ineffective because the bulk of the population and many of
the officials were Christian.  In 317 an edict of toleration
was issued by the associated Emperor Galerius, and in 324
Constantine the Great, a friend and on his deathbed a
baptized convert to Christianity, became sole ruler of the
Roman world.  He abandoned all divine pretensions and put
Christian symbols on the shields and banners of his troops.
</p>

<p>
In a few years Christianity was securely established as the
official religion of the empire.  The competing religions
disappeared or were absorbed with extraordinary celerity, and
in 300 Theodosius the Great caused the great statue of
Jupiter Serapis at Alexandria to be destroyed.  From the
outset of the fifth century onward the only priests or
temples in the Roman Empire were Christian priests and
temples.

<h4 align="center">THE BARBARIANS BREAK THE EMPIRE INTO EAST
AND WEST</h4>

<p>

THROUGHOUT the third century the Roman Empire, decaying
socially and disintegrating morally, faced the barbarians.
  The emperors of this period were fighting military autocrats,
and the capital of the empire shifted with the necessities of
their military policy. Now the imperial headquarters would be
at Milan in north Italy, now in what is now Serbia at Sirmium
or Nish, now in Nicomedia in Asia Minor.  Rome halfway down
Italy was too far from the centre of interest to be a
convenient imperial seat.  It was a declining city.  Over
most of the empire peace still prevailed and men went about
without arms.  The armies continued to be the sole
repositories of power; the emperors, dependent on their
legions, became more and more autocratic to the rest of the
empire and their state more and more like that of the Persian
and other oriental monarchs.  Diocletian assumed a royal
diadem and oriental robes.
</p>

<p>
All along the imperial frontier, which ran roughly along the
Rhine and Danube, enemies were now pressing.  The Franks and
other German tribes had come up to the Rhine.  In north
Hungary were the Vandals; in what was once Dacia and is now
Roumania, the Visigoths or West Goths.  Behind these in south
Russia were the East Goths or Ostrogoths, and beyond these
again in the Volga region the Alans.  But now Mongolian
peoples were forcing their way towards Europe.  The Huns were
already exacting tribute from the Alans and Ostrogoths and
pushing them to the west.
</p>

<p>
In Asia the Roman frontiers were crumpling back under the
push of a renascent Persia.  This new Persia, the Persia of
the Sassenid kings, was to be a vigorous and on the whole a
successful rival of the Roman Empire in Asia for the next
three centuries.
</p>

<p>
A glance at the map of Europe will show the reader the
peculiar weakness of the empire.  The river Danube comes down
to within <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P228"></a>228}</span>a couple of hundred miles of the
Adriatic Sea in the region of what is now Bosnia and Serbia.
  It makes a square re-entrant angle there.  The Romans never
kept their sea communications in good order, and this two
hundred mile strip of land was their line of communication
between the western Latin-speaking part of the empire and the
eastern Greek-speaking portion.  Against this square angle of
the Danube the barbarian pressure was greatest.  When they
broke through there it was inevitable that the empire should
fall into two parts.

</center>

<p>
A more vigorous empire might have thrust forward and
reconquered Dacia, but the Roman Empire lacked any such
vigour.  Constantine the Great was certainly a monarch of
great devotion and intelligence.  He beat back a raid of the
Goths from just these vital Balkan regions, but he had no
force to carry the frontier across the Danube.  He was too
pre-occupied with the internal weaknesses of the empire.  He
brought the solidarity and moral force of Christianity to
revive the spirit of the declining empire, and he decided to
create a new permanent capital at Byzantium upon the
Hellespont.  This new-made Byzantium, which was re-christened
Constantinople in his honour, was still building when he
died.  Towards the end of his reign occurred a remarkable
transaction.  The <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P229"></a>229}</span>Vandals, being pressed by the
Goths, asked to be received into the Roman Empire.  They were
assigned lands in Pannonia, which is now that part of Hungary
west of the Danube, and their fighting men became nominally
legionaries.  But these new legionaries remained under their
own chiefs.  Rome failed to digest them.
</p>

<p>
Constantine died working to reorganize his great realm, and
soon the frontiers were ruptured again and the Visigoths came
almost to Constantinople. They defeated the Emperor Valens at
Adrianople and made a settlement in what is now Bulgaria,
similar to the settlement of the Vandals in Pannonia.
  Nominally they were subjects of the emperor, practically they
were conquerors.

From 379 to 395 <small>A.D.</small> reigned the
Emperor Theodosius the Great, and while he reigned the empire
was still formally intact.  Over the armies of Italy and
Pannonia presided Stilicho, a Vandal, over the armies in the
Balkan peninsula, Alaric, a Goth.  When Theodosius died at
the close of the fourth century he left <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P230"></a>230}</span>two sons.
  Alaric supported one of these, Arcadius, in Constantinople,
and Stilicho the other, Honorius, in Italy.  In other words
Alaric and Stilicho fought for the empire with the princes as
puppets.  In the course of their struggle Alaric marched into
Italy and after a short siege took Rome (410
 <small>A.D.</small>).
</p>

<p>
The opening half of the fifth century saw the whole of the
Roman Empire in Europe the prey of robber armies of
barbarians.  It is difficult to visualize the state of
affairs in the world at that time.  Over France, Spain, Italy
and the Balkan peninsula, the great cities that had
flourished under the early empire still stood, impoverished,
partly depopulated and falling into decay.  Life in them must
have been shallow, mean and full of uncertainty.  Local
officials asserted their authority and went on with their
work with such conscience as they had, no doubt in the name
of a now remote and inaccessible emperor.  The churches went
on, but usually with illiterate priests.  There was little
reading and much superstition and fear.  But everywhere
except where looters had destroyed them, books and pictures
and statuary and such-like works of art were still to be
found.
</p>

<p>
The life of the countryside had also degenerated.  Everywhere
this Roman world was much more weedy and untidy than it had
been.  In some regions war and pestilence had brought the
land down to the level of a waste.  Roads and forests were
infested with robbers.  Into such regions the barbarians
marched, with little or no opposition, and set up their
chiefs as rulers, often with Roman official titles.  If they
were half civilized barbarians they would give the conquered
districts tolerable terms, they would take possession of the
towns, associate and intermarry, and acquire (with an accent)
the Latin speech; but the Jutes, the Angles and Saxons who
submerged the Roman province of Britain were agriculturalists
and had no use for towns, they seem to have swept south
Britain clear of the Romanized population and they replaced
the language by their own Teutonic dialects, which became at
last English.

It is impossible in the space at our disposal to trace the
movements of all the various German and Slavonic tribes as
they went to and fro in the disorganized empire in search of
plunder and a pleasant home.  But let the Vandals serve as an
example.  They came into <span class="pagenum">{<a

settled as we have told in Pannonia.  Thence they moved
somewhen about 425 <small>A.D.</small> through the
intervening provinces to Spain.  There they found Visigoths
from South Russia and other German tribes setting up dukes
and kings.  From Spain the Vandals under Genseric sailed for
North Africa (429), captured Carthage (439), and built a
fleet.  They secured the mastery of the sea and captured and
pillaged Rome (455), which had recovered very imperfectly
from her capture and looting by Alaric half a century
earlier.  Then the Vandals made themselves masters of Sicily,
Corsica, Sardinia and most of the other islands of the
western Mediterranean.  They made, in fact, a sea empire very
similar in its extent to the sea empire of Carthage seven
hundred odd years before.  They were at the climax of their
power about 477.  They were a mere handful of conquerors
holding all this country.  In the next century almost all
their territory had been reconquered for the empire of
Constantinople during a transitory blaze of energy under
Justinian I.
</p>

<p>
The story of the Vandals is but one sample of a host of
similar adventures.  But now there was coming into the
European world the least kindred and most redoubtable of all
these devastators, the Mongolian Huns or Tartars, a yellow
people active and able, such as the western world had never
before encountered.

<h4 align="center">THE HUNS AND THE END OF THE WESTERN
EMPIRE</h4>

<p>

THIS appearance of a conquering Mongolian people in Europe
may be taken to mark a new stage in human history.  Until the
last century or so before the Christian era, the Mongol and
the Nordic peoples had not been in close touch.  Far away in
the frozen lands beyond the northern forests the Lapps, a
Mongolian people, had drifted westward as far as Lapland, but
they played no part in the main current of history.  For
thousands of years the western world carried on the dramatic
interplay of the Aryan, Semitic and fundamental brunette
peoples with very little interference (except for an
Ethiopian invasion of Egypt or so) either from the black
peoples to the south or from the Mongolian world in the far
East.
</p>

<p>
It is probable that there were two chief causes for the new
westward drift of the nomadic Mongolians.  One was the
consolidation of the great empire of China, its extension
northward and the increase of its population during the
prosperous period of the Han dynasty.  The other was some
process of climatic change; a lesser rainfall that abolished
swamps and forests perhaps, or a greater rainfall that
extended grazing over desert steppes, or even perhaps both
these processes going on in different regions but which
anyhow facilitated a westward migration.  A third
contributary cause was the economic wretchedness, internal
decay and falling population of the Roman Empire.  The rich
men of the later Roman Republic, and then the tax-gatherers
of the military emperors had utterly consumed its vitality.
  So we have the factors of thrust, means and opportunity.
  There was pressure from the east, rot in the west and an open
road.
</p>

<p>
The Hun had reached the eastern boundaries of European Russia
by the first century <small>A.D.</small>, but it was
not until the fourth and <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P234"></a>234}</span>fifth centuries
 <small>A.D.</small> that these horsemen rose to predominance upon
the steppes.  The fifth century was the Hun&rsquo;s century.
  The first Huns to come into Italy were mercenary bands in the
pay of Stilicho the Vandal, the master of Honorius.
  Presently they were in possession of Pannonia, the empty nest
of the Vandals.
</p>

<p>
By the second quarter of the fifth century a great war chief
had arisen among the Huns, Attila.  We have only vague and
tantalizing glimpses of his power.  He ruled not only over
the Huns but over a conglomerate of tributary Germanic
tribes; his empire extended from the Rhine cross the plains
into Central Asia.  He exchanged ambassadors with China.  His
head camp was in the plain of Hungary east of the Danube.
  There he was visited by an envoy from Constantinople,
Priscus, who has left us an account of his state.  The way of
living of these Mongols was very like the way of living of
the primitive Aryans they had replaced.  The common folk were
in huts and tents; the chiefs lived in great stockaded timber
halls.  There were feasts and drinking and singing by the
bards.  The Homeric heroes and even the Macedonian companions
of Alexander would probably have felt more at home in the
camp-capital of Attila than they would have done in the
cultivated and decadent court of Theodosius II, the son of
Arcadius, who was then reigning in Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
For a time it seemed as though the nomads under the
leadership of the Huns and Attila would play the same part
towards the Gr&#230;co-Roman civilization of the
Mediterranean countries that the barbaric Greeks had played
long ago to the &#198;gean civilization.  It looked like
history repeating itself upon a larger stage.  But the Huns
were much more wedded to the nomadic life than the early
Greeks, who were rather migratory cattle farmers than true
nomads.  The Huns raided and plundered but did not settle.
</p>

<p>
For some years Attila bullied Theodosius as he chose.  His
armies devastated and looted right down to the walls of
Constantinople, Gibbon says that he totally destroyed no less
than seventy cities in the Balkan peninsula, and Theodosius
bought him off by payments of tribute and tried to get rid of
him for good by sending secret agents to assassinate him.  In
451 Attila turned his attention to the remains of the Latin-
speaking half of the empire and invaded <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P235"></a>235}</span>Gaul.  Nearly
every town in northern Gaul was sacked.  Franks, Visigoths
and the imperial forces united against him and he was
defeated at Troyes in a vast dispersed battle in which a
multitude of men, variously estimated as between 150,000 and
300,000, were killed. This checked him in Gaul, but it did
not exhaust his enormous military resources.  Next year he
came into Italy by way of Venetia, burnt Aquileia and Padua
and looted Milan.

<p>
Numbers of fugitives from these north Italian towns and
particularly from Padua fled to islands in the lagoons at the
head of the Adriatic and laid there the foundations of the
city state of Venice, which was to become one of the greatest
or the trading centres in the middle ages.
</p>

<p>
In 453 Attila died suddenly after a great feast to celebrate
his marriage to a young woman, and at his death this plunder
confederation of his fell to pieces.  The actual Huns
disappear from history, mixed into the surrounding more
numerous Aryan-speaking populations.  <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P236"></a>236}</span>But these
great Hun raids practically consummated the end of the Latin
Roman Empire.  After his death ten different emperors ruled
in Rome in twenty years, set up by Vandal and other mercenary
troops.  The Vandals from Carthage took and sacked Rome in
455.  Finally in 476 Odoacer, the chief of the barbarian
troops, suppressed a Pannonian who was figuring as emperor
under the impressive name of Romulus Augustulus, and informed
the Court of Constantinople that there was no longer an
emperor in the west.  So ingloriously the Latin Roman Empire
came to an end.  In 493 Theodoric the Goth became King of
Rome.
</p>

<p>
All over western and central Europe now barbarian chiefs were
reigning as kings, dukes and the like, practically
independent but for the most part professing some sort of
shadowy allegiance to the emperor.  There were hundreds and
perhaps thousands of such practically independent brigand
rulers.  In Gaul, Spain and Italy and in Dacia the Latin
speech still prevailed in locally distorted forms, but in
Britain and east of the Rhine languages of the German group
(or in Bohemia a Slavonic language, Czech) were the common
speech.  The superior clergy and a small remnant of other
educated men read and wrote Latin.  Everywhere life was
insecure and property was held by the strong arm.  Castles
multiplied and roads fell into decay.  The dawn of the sixth
century was an age of division and of intellectual darkness
throughout the western world.  Had it not been for the monks
and Christian missionaries Latin learning might have perished
altogether.
</p>

<p>
Why had the Roman Empire grown and why had it so completely
decayed?  It grew because at first the idea of citizenship
held it together.  Throughout the days of the expanding
republic, and even into the days of the early empire there
remained a great number of men conscious of Roman
citizenship, feeling it a privilege and an obligation to be a
Roman citizen, confident of their rights under the Roman law
and willing to make sacrifices in the name of Rome.  The
prestige of Rome as of something just and great and law-
upholding spread far beyond the Roman boundaries.  But even
as early as the Punic wars the sense of citizenship was being
undermined by the growth of wealth and slavery.  Citizenship
spread indeed but not the idea of citizenship.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P237"></a>237}</span>The
Roman Empire was after all a very primitive organization; it
did not educate, did not explain itself to its increasing
multitudes of citizens, did not invite their co-operation in
its decisions.  There was no network of schools to ensure a
common understanding, no distribution of news to sustain
collective activity.  The adventurers who struggled for power
from the days of Marius and Sulla onward had no idea of
creating and calling in public opinion upon the imperial
affairs.  The spirit of citizenship died of starvation and no
one observed it die.  All empires, all states, all
organizations of human society are, in the ultimate, things
of understanding and will.  There remained no will for the
Roman Empire in the World and so it came to an end.
</p>

<p>
But though the Latin-speaking Roman Empire died in the fifth
century, something else had been born within it that was to
avail itself enormously of its prestige and tradition, and
that was the Latin-speaking half of the Catholic Church.
  This lived while the empire died because it appealed to the
minds and wills of men, because it had books and a great
system of teachers and missionaries to hold it together,
things stronger than any law or legions.  Throughout the
fourth and fifth centuries <small>A.D.</small> while
the empire was decaying, Christianity was spreading to a
universal dominion in Europe.  It conquered its conquerors,
the barbarians.  When Attila seemed disposed to march on
Rome, the patriarch of Rome intercepted him and did what no
armies could do, turning him back by sheer moral force.
</p>

<p>
The Patriarch or Pope of Rome claimed to be the head of the
entire Christian church.  Now that there were no more
emperors, he began to annex imperial titles and claims.  He
took the title of <i>pontifex maximus</i>, head sacrificial
priest of the Roman dominion, the most ancient of all the
titles that the emperors had enjoyed.

<h4 align="center">THE BYZANTINE AND SASSANID EMPIRES</h4>

<p>

THE Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman Empire showed
much more political tenacity than the western half.  It
weathered the disasters of the fifth century
 <small>A.D.</small>, which saw a complete and final breaking up
of the original Latin Roman power.  Attila bullied the
Emperor Theodosius II and sacked and raided almost to the
walls of Constantinople, but that city remained intact.  The
Nubians came down the Nile and looted Upper Egypt, but Lower
Egypt and Alexandria were left still fairly prosperous.  Most
of Asia Minor was held against the Sassanid Persians.
</p>

<p>
The sixth century, which was an age of complete darkness for
the West, saw indeed a considerable revival of the Greek
power.  Justinian I (527-565) was a ruler of very great
ambition and energy, and he was married to the Empress
Theodora, a woman of quite equal capacity who had begun life
as an actress.  Justinian reconquered North Africa from the
Vandals and most of Italy from the Goths.  He even regained
the south of Spain.  He did not limit his energies to naval
and military enterprises.  He founded a university, built the
great church of Sta. Sophia in Constantinople and codified
the Roman law.  But in order to destroy a rival to his
university foundation he closed the schools of philosophy in
Athens, which had been going on in unbroken continuity from
the days of Plato, that is to say for nearly a thousand
years.
</p>

<p>
From the third century onwards the Persian Empire had been
the steadfast rival of the Byzantine.  The two empires kept
Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt in a state of perpetual unrest
and waste.  In the first century
 <small>A.D.</small>, these lands were still at a high level of
civilization, wealthy and with an abundant population, but
the continual coming and going of armies, massacres, looting
and war taxation wore them down steadily until only shattered
and ruinous <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P239"></a>239}</span>cities remained upon a countryside
of scattered peasants.  In this melancholy process of
impoverishment and disorder lower Egypt fared perhaps less
badly than the rest of the world.  Alexandria, like
Constantinople, continued a dwindling trade between the east
and the west.

<p>
Science and political philosophy seemed dead now in both
these warring and decaying empires.  The last philosophers of
Athens, until their suppression, preserved the texts of the
great literature of the past with an infinite reverence and
want of understanding.  But there remained no class of men in
the world, no free gentlemen with bold and independent habits
of thought, to carry on the tradition of frank statement and
enquiry embodied in these writings.  The social and political
chaos accounts largely for the disappearance of this class,
but there was also another reason why the human intelligence
was sterile and feverish during this age.  In both Persia and
Byzantium it was all age of intolerance.  Both empires were
religious empires in a new way, in a way that greatly
hampered the free activities of the human mind.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P240"></a>240}</span>Of
course the oldest empires in the world were religious
empires, centring upon the worship of a god or of a god-king.
  Alexander was treated as a divinity and the C&#230;sars were
gods in so much as they had altars and temples devoted to
them and the offering of incense was made a test of loyalty
to the Roman state.  But these older religions were
essentially religions of act and fact.  They did not invade
the mind.  If a man offered his sacrifice and bowed to the
god, he was left not only to think but to say practically
whatever he liked about the affair.  But the new sort of
religions that had come into the world, and particularly
Christianity, turned inward.  These new faiths demanded not
simply conformity but understanding belief.  Naturally fierce
controversy ensued upon the exact meaning of the things
believed.  These new religions were creed religions.  The
world was confronted with a new word, Orthodoxy, and with a
stern resolve to keep not only acts but speech <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P241"></a>241}</span>and private
thought within the limits of a set teaching.  For to hold a
wrong opinion, much more to convey it to other people, was no
longer regarded as an intellectual defect but a moral fault
that might condemn a soul to everlasting destruction.

Both Ardashir I who founded the Sassanid dynasty in the third
century <small>A.D.</small>, and Constantine the
Great who reconstructed the Roman Empire in the fourth,
turned to religious organizations for help, because in these
organizations they saw a new means of using and controlling
the wills of men.  And already before the end of the fourth
century both empires were persecuting free talk and religious
innovation.  In Persia Ardashir found the ancient Persian
religion of Zoroaster (or Zarathushtra) with its priests and
temples and a sacred fire that burnt upon its altars, ready
for his purpose as a state religion.  Before the end of the
third century Zoroastrianism was persecuting Christianity,
and in 277 <small>A.D.</small> Mani, the founder of
<span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P243"></a>243}</span>a new faith,
the Manich&#230;ans, was crucified and his body flayed.
  Constantinople, on its side, was busy hunting out Christian
heresies.  Manich&#230;an ideas infected Christianity and had
to be fought with the fiercest methods; in return ideas from
Christianity affected the purity of the Zoroastrian doctrine.
  All ideas became suspect.  Science, which demands before all
things the free action of an untroubled mind, suffered a
complete eclipse throughout this phase of intolerance.
</p>

<p>
War, the bitterest theology, and the usual vices of mankind
constituted Byzantine life of those days.  It was
picturesque, it was romantic; it had little sweetness or
light.  When Byzantium and Persia were not fighting the
barbarians from the north, they wasted Asia Minor and Syria
in dreary and destructive hostilities.  Even in close
alliance these two empires would have found it a hard task to
turn back the barbarians and recover their prosperity.  The
Turks or Tartars first come into history as the allies first
of one power and then of another.  In the sixth century the
two chief antagonists were Justinian and Chosroes I; in the
opening of the seventh the Emperor Heraclius was pitted
against Chosroes II (580).
</p>

<p>
At first and until after Heraclius had become Emperor (610)
Chosroes II carried all before him.  He took Antioch,
Damascus and Jerusalem and his armies reached Chalcedon,
which is in Asia Minor over against Constantinople.  In 619
he conquered Egypt.  Then Heraclius pressed a counter attack
home and routed a Persian army at Nineveh (627), although at
that time there were still Persian troops at Chalcedon.  In
628 Chosroes II was deposed and murdered by his son, Kavadh,
and an inconclusive peace was made between the two exhausted
empires.
</p>

<p>
Byzantium and Persia had fought their last war.  But few
people as yet dreamt of the storm that was even then
gathering in the deserts to put an end for ever to this
aimless, chronic struggle.
</p>

<p>
While Heraclius was restoring order in Syria a message
reached him.  It had been brought in to the imperial outpost
at Bostra south of Damascus; it was in Arabic, an obscure
Semitic desert language, and it was read to the Emperor, if
it reached him at all, by an interpreter.  It was from
someone who called himself &ldquo;Muhammad the Prophet of
God.&rdquo;  It called upon the Emperor to <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P244"></a>244}</span>acknowledge
the One True God and to serve him.  What the Emperor said is
not recorded.
</p>

<p>
A similar message came to Kavadh at Ctesiphon.  He was
annoyed, tore up the letter, and bade the messenger begone.
</p>

<p>
This Muhammad, it appeared, was a Bedouin leader whose
headquarters were in the mean little desert town of Medina.
  He was preaching a new religion of faith in the One True God.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Even so, O Lord!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;rend thou his
Kingdom from Kavadh.&rdquo;

<h4 align="center">THE DYNASTIES OF SUY AND TANG IN
CHINA</h4>

<p>

THROUGHOUT the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth centuries,
there was a steady drift of Mongolian peoples westward.  The
Huns of Attila were merely precursors of this advance, which
led at last to the establishment of Mongolian peoples in
Finland, Esthonia, Hungary and Bulgaria, where their
descendants, speaking languages akin to Turkish, survive to
this day.  The Mongolian nomads were, in fact, playing a role
towards the Aryanized civilizations of Europe and Persia and
India that the Aryans had played to the &#198;gean and
Semitic civilizations ten or fifteen centuries before.
</p>

<p>
In Central Asia the Turkish peoples had taken root in what is
now Western Turkestan, and Persia already employed many
Turkish officials and Turkish mercenaries.  The Parthians had
gone out of history, absorbed into the general population of
Persia.  There were no more Aryan nomads in the history of
Central Asia; Mongolian people had replaced them.  The Turks
became masters of Asia from China to the Caspian.
</p>

<p>
The same great pestilence at the end of the second century
<small>A.D.</small> that had shattered the Roman
Empire had overthrown the Han dynasty in China.  Then came a
period of division and of Hunnish conquests from which China
arose refreshed, more rapidly and more completely than Europe
was destined to do.  Before the end of the sixth century
China was reunited under the Suy dynasty, and this by the
time of Heraclius gave place to the Tang dynasty, whose reign
marks another great period of prosperity for China.

<p>
Throughout the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries China was
the most secure and civilized country in the world.  The Han
dynasty had extended her boundaries in the north; the Suy and
Tang dynasties now spread her civilization to the south, and
China <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P247"></a>247}</span>began to
 assume the proportions she has to-day.  In Central Asia indeed she
 reached much further, extending at last, through tributary Turkish
 tribes, to Persia and the Caspian Sea.
</p>

<p>
The new China that had arisen was a very different land from
the old China of the Hans.  A new and more vigorous literary
school appeared, there was a great poetic revival; Buddhism
had revolutionized philosophical and religious thought.
  There were great advances in artistic work, in technical
skill and in all the amenities of life.  Tea was first used,
paper manufactured and wood-block printing began.  Millions
of people indeed were leading orderly, graceful and kindly
lives in China during these centuries when the attenuated
populations of Europe and Western Asia were living either in
hovels, small walled cities or grim robber fortresses.  While
the mind of the west was black with theological obsessions,
the mind of China was open and tolerant and enquiring.
</p>

<p>
One of the earliest monarchs of the Tang dynasty was Tai-
tsung, who began to reign in 627, the year of the victory of
Heraclius at Nineveh.  He received an embassy from Heraclius,
who was probably seeking an ally in the rear of Persia.  From
Persia itself came a party of Christian missionaries (635).
  They were allowed to explain their creed to Tai-tsung and he
examined a Chinese translation of their Scriptures.  He
pronounced this strange religion acceptable, and gave
permission for the foundation of a church and monastery.
</p>

<p>
To this monarch also (in 628) came messengers from Muhammad.
  They came to Canton on a trading ship.  They had sailed the
whole way from Arabia along the Indian coasts.  Unlike
Heraclius and Kavadh, Tai-Tsung gave these envoys a courteous
hearing.  He expressed his interest in their theological
ideas and assisted them to build a mosque in Canton, a mosque
which survives, it is said, to this day, the oldest mosque in
the world.

<p>

A PROPHETIC amateur of history surveying the world in the
opening of the seventh century might have concluded very
reasonably that it was only a question of a few centuries
before the whole of Europe and Asia fell under Mongolian
domination.  There were no signs of order or union in Western
Europe, and the Byzantine and Persian Empires were manifestly
bent upon a mutual destruction.  India also was divided and
wasted.  On the other hand China was a steadily expanding
empire which probably at that time exceeded all Europe in
population, and the Turkish people who were growing to power
in Central Asia were disposed to work in accord with China.
  And such a prophecy would not have been an altogether vain
one.  A time was to come in the thirteenth century when a
Mongolian overlord would rule from the Danube to the Pacific,
and Turkish dynasties were destined to reign over the entire
Byzantine and Persian Empires, over Egypt and most of India.
</p>

<p>
Where our prophet would have been most likely to have erred
would have been in under-estimating the recuperative power of
the Latin end of Europe and in ignoring the latent forces of
the Arabian desert.  Arabia would have seemed what it had
been for times immemorial, the refuge of small and bickering
nomadic tribes.  No Semitic people had founded an empire now
for more than a thousand years.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly the Bedouin flared out for a brief century of
splendour.  They spread their rule and language from Spain to
the boundaries of China.  They gave the world a new culture.
  They created a religion that is still to this day one of the
most vital forces in the world.

who fired this Arab flame appears first in history as the
young husband of the widow of a rich merchant of the town of
Mecca, named Muhammad.  Until he was forty he did very little
to distinguish himself in the world.  He seems to have taken
considerable interest in religious discussion.  Mecca was a
pagan city at that time worshipping in particular a black
stone, the Kaaba, of great repute throughout all Arabia and a
centre of pilgrimages; but there were great numbers of Jews
in the country&#8212;indeed all the southern portion of
Arabia professed the Jewish faith&#8212;and there were
Christian churches in Syria.
</p>

<p>
About forty Muhammad began to develop prophetic
characteristics like those of the Hebrew prophets twelve
hundred years before him.  He talked first to his wife of the
One True God, and of the rewards and punishments of virtue
and wickedness.  There can be no doubt that his thoughts were
very strongly influenced by Jewish and Christian ideas.  He
gathered about him a small circle of believers and presently
began to preach in the town against the prevalent idolatry.
  This made him extremely unpopular with his fellow townsmen
because the pilgrimages to the Kaaba were the chief source of
such prosperity as Mecca enjoyed.  He became bolder and more
definite in his teaching, declaring himself to be the last
chosen prophet of God entrusted with a mission to perfect
religion.  Abraham, he declared, and Jesus Christ were his
forerunners.  He had been chosen to complete and perfect the
revelation of God&rsquo;s will.
</p>

<p>
He produced verses which he said had been communicated to him
by an angel, and he had a strange vision in which he was
taken up through the Heavens to God and instructed in his
mission.

<p>
As his teaching increased in force the hostility of his
fellow townsmen increased also.  At last a plot was made to
kill him; but he escaped with his faithful friend and
disciple, Abu Bekr, to the friendly town of Medina which
adopted his doctrine.  Hostilities followed between Mecca and
Medina which ended at last in a treaty.  Mecca was to adopt
the worship of the One True God and accept Muhammad as his
prophet, <i>but the adherents of the new faith were still to
make the pilgrimage to Mecca</i> just as they had done when
they were pagans.  So Muhammad established the One True God
in <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P251"></a>251}</span>Mecca without
injuring its pilgrim traffic.  In 629 Muhammad returned to
Mecca as its master, a year after he had sent out these
envoys of his to Heraclius, Tai-tsung, Kavadh and all the
rulers of the earth.

<p>
Then for four years more until his death in 632, Muhammad
spread his power over the rest of Arabia.  He married a
number of wives in his declining years, and his life on the
whole was by modern standards unedifying.  He seems to have
been a man compounded of very considerable vanity, greed,
cunning, self-deception and quite sincere religious passion.
  He dictated a book of injunctions and expositions, the Koran,
which he declared was communicated to him from God.  Regarded
as literature or philosophy the Koran is certainly unworthy
of its alleged Divine authorship.
</p>

<p>
Yet when the manifest defects of Muhammad&rsquo;s life and
writings have been allowed for, there remains in Islam, this
faith he imposed upon the Arabs, much power and inspiration.
  One is its uncompromising monotheism; its simple enthusiastic
faith in the rule and fatherhood of God and its freedom from
theological complications.  Another is its complete
detachment from the sacrificial priest and the temple.  It is
an entirely prophetic religion, proof against any possibility
of relapse towards blood sacrifices.  In the Koran the
limited <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P252"></a>252}</span>and ceremonial nature of the
pilgrimage to Mecca is stated beyond the possibility of
dispute, and every precaution was taken by Muhammad to
prevent the deification of himself after his death.  And a
third element of strength lay in the insistence of Islam upon
the perfect brotherhood and equality before God of all
believers, whatever their colour, origin or status.
</p>

<p>
These are the things that made Islam a power in human
affairs.  It has been said that the true founder of the
Empire of Islam was not so much Muhammad as his friend and
helper, Abu Bekr.  If Muhammad, with his shifty character,
was the mind and imagination of primitive Islam, Abu Bekr was
its conscience and its will.  Whenever Muhammad wavered Abu
Bekr sustained him.  And when Muhammad died, Abu Bekr became
Caliph (= successor), and with that faith that moves
mountains, he set himself simply and sanely to organize the
subjugation of the whole world to Allah&#8212;with little
armies of 3,000 or 4,000 Arabs&#8212;according to those
letters the prophet had written from Medina in 628 to all the
monarchs of the world.

<h4 align="center">THE GREAT DAYS OF THE ARABS</h4>

<p>

THERE follows the most amazing story of conquest in the whole
history of our race.  The Byzantine army was smashed at the
battle of the Yarmuk (a tributary of the Jordan) in 634; and
the Emperor Heraclius, his energy sapped by dropsy and his
resources exhausted by the Persian war, saw his new conquests
in Syria, Damascus, Palmyra, Antioch, Jerusalem and the rest
fall almost without resistance to the Moslim.  Large elements
in the population went over to Islam.  Then the Moslim turned
east.  The Persians had found an able general in Rustam; they
had a great host with a force of elephants; and for three
days they fought the Arabs at Kadessia (637) and broke at
last in headlong rout.
</p>

<p>
The conquest of all Persia followed, and the Moslem Empire
pushed far into Western Turkestan and eastward until it met
the Chinese.  Egypt fell almost without resistance to the new
conquerors, who full of a fanatical belief in the sufficiency
of the Koran, wiped out the vestiges of the book-copying
industry of the Alexandria Library.  The tide of conquest
poured along the north coast of Africa to the Straits of
Gibraltar and Spain.  Spain was invaded in 710 and the
Pyrenees Mountains were reached in 720.  In 732 the Arab
advance had reached the centre of France, but here it was
stopped for good at the battle of Poitiers and thrust back as
far as the Pyrenees again.  The conquest of Egypt had given
the Moslim a fleet, and for a time it looked as though they
would take Constantinople.  They made repeated sea attacks
between 672 and 718 but the great city held out against them.

<p>
The Arabs had little political aptitude and no political
experience, and this great empire with its capital now at
Damascus, which stretched from Spain to China, was destined
to break up very speedily. From the very beginning doctrinal
differences undermined <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P254"></a>254}</span>its unity.  But our interest here
lies not with the story of its political disintegration but
with its effect upon the human mind and upon the general
destinies of our race.  The Arab intelligence had been flung
across the world even more swiftly and dramatically than had
the Greek a thousand years before.  The intellectual
stimulation of the whole world west of China, the break-up of
old ideas and development of new ones, was enormous.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P255"></a>255}</span>In
Persia this fresh excited Arabic mind came into contact not
only with Manich&#230;an, Zoroastrian and Christian doctrine,
but with the scientific Greek literature, preserved not only
in Greek but in Syrian translations.  It found Greek learning
in Egypt also. Every-where, and particularly in Spain, it
discovered an active Jewish tradition of speculation and
discussion.  In Central Asia it met Buddhism and the material
achievements of Chinese civilization.  It learnt the
manufacture of paper&#8212;which made printed books
possible&#8212;from the Chinese.  And finally it came into
touch with Indian mathematics and philosophy.

<p>
Very speedily the intolerant self-sufficiency of the early
days of faith, which made the Koran seem the only possible
book, was dropped. Learning sprang up everywhere in the
footsteps of the Arab conquerors.  By the eighth century
there was an educational <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P256"></a>256}</span>organization throughout the whole
&ldquo;Arabized&rdquo; world.  In the ninth learned men in
the schools of Cordoba in Spain were corresponding with
learned men in Cairo, Bagdad, Bokhara and Samarkand.  The
Jewish mind assimilated very readily with the Arab, and for a
time the two Semitic races worked together through the medium
of Arabic.  Long after the political break-up and
enfeeblement of the Arabs, this intellectual community of the
Arab-speaking world endured.  It was still producing very
considerable results in the thirteenth century.

<p>
So it was that the systematic accumulation and criticism of
facts which was first begun by the Greeks was resumed in this
astonishing renascence of the Semitic world.  The seed of
Aristotle and the museum of Alexandria that had lain so long
inactive and neglected now germinated and began to grow
towards fruition.  Very great advances were made in
mathematical, medical and physical science.  <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P257"></a>257}</span>The clumsy
Roman numerals were ousted by the Arabic figures we use to
this day and the zero sign was first employed.  The very name
algebra is Arabic.  So is the word chemistry.  The names of
such stars as Algol, Aldebaran and Bo&#246;tes preserve the
traces of Arab conquests in the sky.  Their philosophy was
destined to reanimate the medieval philosophy of France and
Italy and the whole Christian world.
</p>

<p>
The Arab experimental chemists were called alchemists, and
they were still sufficiently barbaric in spirit to keep their
methods and results secret as far as possible.  They realized
from the very beginning what enormous advantages their
possible discoveries might give them, and what far-reaching
consequences they might have on human life.  They came upon
many metallurgical and technical devices of the utmost value,
alloys and dyes, distilling, tinctures and essences, optical
glass; but the two chief ends they sought, they sought in
vain.  One was &ldquo;the philosopher&rsquo;s
stone&rdquo;&#8212;a means of changing the metallic elements
one into another and so getting a control of artificial gold,
and the other was the <i>elixir vit&#339;</i>, a stimulant
that would revivify age and prolong life indefinitely.  The
crabbed patient experimenting of these Arab alchemists spread
into the Christian world.  The fascination of their enquiries
spread.  Very gradually the activities of these alchemists
became more social and co-operative.  They found it
profitable to exchange and compare ideas.  By insensible
gradations the last of the alchemists became the first of the
experimental philosophers.
</p>

<p>
The old alchemists sought the philosopher&rsquo;s stone which
was to transmute base metals to gold, and an elixir of
immortality; they found the methods of modern experimental
science which promise in the end to give man illimitable
power over the world and over his own destiny.

<h4 align="center">THE DEVELOPMENT OF LATIN CHRISTENDOM</h4>

<p>

IT is worth while to note the extremely shrunken dimensions
of the share of the world remaining under Aryan control in
the seventh and eighth centuries.  A thousand years before,
the Aryan-speaking races were triumphant over all the
civilized world west of China.  Now the Mongol had thrust as
far as Hungary, nothing of Asia remained under Aryan rule
except the Byzantine dominions in Asia Minor, and all Africa
was lost and nearly all Spain.  The great Hellenic world had
shrunken to a few possessions round the nucleus of the
trading city of Constantinople, and the memory of the Roman
world was kept alive by the Latin of the western Christian
priests.  In vivid contrast to this tale of retrogression,
the Semitic tradition had risen again from subjugation and
obscurity after a thousand years of darkness.
</p>

<p>
Yet the vitality of the Nordic peoples was not exhausted.
  Confined now to Central and North-Western Europe and terribly
muddled in their social and political ideas, they were
nevertheless building up gradually and steadily a new social
order and preparing unconsciously for the recovery of a power
even more extensive than that they had previously enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
We have told how at the beginning of the sixth century there
remained no central government in Western Europe at all.
  That world was divided up among numbers of local rulers
holding their own as they could.  This was too insecure a
state of affairs to last; a system of co-operation and
association grew up in this disorder, the feudal system,
which has left its traces upon European life up to the
present time.  This feudal system was a sort of
crystallization of society about power.  Everywhere the lone
man felt insecure and was prepared to barter a certain amount
of his liberty for help and protection.  He sought a stronger
man as his lord and protector; <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P259"></a>259}</span>he gave him military services and
paid him dues, and in return he was confirmed in his
possession of what was his.  His lord again found safety in
vassalage to a still greater lord.  Cities also found it
convenient to have feudal protectors, and monasteries and
church estates bound themselves by similar ties.  No doubt in
many cases allegiance was claimed before it was offered; the
system grew downward as well as upward.  So a sort of
pyramidal system grew up, varying widely in different
localities, permitting at first a considerable play of
violence and private warfare but making steadily for order
and a new reign of law.  The pyramids grew up until some
became recognizable as kingdoms.  Already by the early sixth
century a Frankish kingdom existed under its founder Clovis
in what is now France and the Netherlands, and presently
Visigothic and Lombard and Gothic kingdoms were in existence.
</p>

<p>
The Moslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this
Frankish kingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel,
the Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis,
and experienced the decisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his
hands.  This Charles Martel was practically overlord of
Europe north of the Alps from the Pyrenees to Hungary.  He
ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords speaking French-
Latin, and High and Low German languages.  His son Pepin
extinguished the last descendants of Clovis and took the
kingly state and title.  His grandson Charlemagne, who began
to reign in 768, found himself lord of a realm so large that
he could think of reviving the title of Latin Emperor.  He
conquered North Italy and made himself master of Rome.

<p>
Approaching the story of Europe as we do from the wider
horizons of a world history we can see much more distinctly
than the mere nationalist historian how cramping and
disastrous this tradition of the Latin Roman Empire was.  A
narrow intense struggle for this phantom predominance was to
consume European energy for more than a thousand years.
  Through all that period it is possible to trace certain
unquenchable antagonisms; they run through the wits of Europe
like the obsessions of a demented mind.  One driving force
was this ambition of successful rulers, which Charlemagne
(Charles the Great) embodied, to become C&#230;sar.  The
realm of Charlemagne consisted of a complex of feudal German
states at <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P260"></a>260}</span>various stages of barbarism.  West
of the Rhine, most of these German peoples had learnt to
speak various Latinized dialects which fused at last to form
French.  East of the Rhine, the racially similar German
peoples did not lose their German speech.  On account of
this, communication was difficult between these two groups of
barbarian conquerors and a split easily brought about.  The
split was made the more easy by the fact that the Frankish
usage made it seem natural to divide the empire of
Charlemagne among his sons at his death.  So one aspect of
the history of Europe from the days of Charlemagne onwards is
a history of first this monarch and his family and then that,
struggling to a precarious headship of the kings, princes,
dukes, bishops and cities of Europe, while a steadily
deepening antagonism between the French and German speaking
elements develops in the medley.  There was a formality of
election for each emperor; and the climax of his ambition was
to struggle to the possession of that worn-out, misplaced
capital Rome and to a coronation there.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P261"></a>261}</span>The next
factor in the European political disorder was the resolve of
the Church at Rome to make no temporal prince but the Pope of
Rome himself emperor in effect.  He was already pontifex
maximus; for all practical purposes he held the decaying
city; if he had no armies he had at least a vast propaganda
organization in his priests throughout the whole Latin world;
if he had little power over men&rsquo;s bodies he held the
keys of heaven and hell in their imaginations and could
exercise much influence upon their souls.  So throughout the
middle ages while one prince man&#339;uvred against another
first for equality, then for ascendancy, and at last for the
supreme prize, the Pope of Rome, sometimes boldly, sometimes
craftily, sometimes feebly&#8212;for the Popes were a
succession of oldish men and the average reign of a Pope was
not more than two years&#8212;man&#339;uvred for the
submission of all the princes to himself as the ultimate
overlord of Christendom.
</p>

<p>
But these antagonisms of prince against prince and of Emperor
against Pope do not by any means exhaust the factors of the
European confusion.  There was still an Emperor in
Constantinople speaking Greek and claiming the allegiance of
all Europe.  When Charlemagne sought to revive the empire, it
was merely the Latin end of the empire he revived.  It was
natural that a sense of rivalry between Latin Empire and
Greek Empire should develop very readily.  And still more
readily did the rivalry of Greek-speaking Christianity and
the newer Latin-speaking version develop.  The Pope of Rome
claimed to be the successor of St. Peter, the chief of the
apostles of Christ, and the head of the Christian community
everywhere.  Neither the emperor nor the patriarch in
Constantinople were disposed to acknowledge this claim.  A
dispute about a fine point in the doctrine of the Holy
Trinity consummated a long series of dissensions in a final
rupture in 1054.  The Latin Church and the Greek Church
became and remained thereafter distinct and frankly
antagonistic.  This antagonism must be added to the others in
our estimate of the conflicts that wasted Latin Christendom
in the middle ages.

<p>
Upon this divided world of Christendom rained the blows of
three sets of antagonists.  About the Baltic and North Seas
remained a series of Nordic tribes who were only very slowly
and reluctantly <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P263"></a>263}</span>Christianized; these were the
Northmen.  They had taken to the sea and piracy, and were
raiding all the Christian coasts down to Spain.  They had
pushed up the Russian rivers to the desolate central lands
and brought their shipping over into the south-flowing
rivers.  They had come out upon the Caspian and Black Seas as
pirates also.  They set up principalities in Russia; they
were the first people to be called Russians.  These Northmen
Russians came near to taking Constantinople.  England in the
early ninth century was a Christianized Low German country
under a king, Egbert, a prot&#233;g&#233; and pupil of
Charlemagne.  The Northmen wrested half the kingdom from his
successor Alfred the Great (886), and finally under Canute
(1016) made themselves masters of the whole land.  Under
Rolph the Ganger (912) another band of Northmen conquered the
north of France, which became Normandy.
</p>

<p>
Canute ruled not only over England but over Norway and
Denmark, but his brief empire fell to pieces at his death
through that political weakness of the barbaric
peoples&#8212;division among a ruler&rsquo;s sons.  It is
interesting to speculate what might have happened if this
temporary union of the Northmen had endured.  They were a
race of astonishing boldness and energy.  They sailed in
their galleys even to Iceland and Greenland.  They were the
first Europeans to land on American soil.  Later on Norman
adventurers were to recover Sicily from the Saracens and sack
Rome.  It is a fascinating thing to imagine what a great
northern sea-faring power might have grown out of
Canute&rsquo;s kingdom, reaching from America to Russia.
</p>

<p>
To the east of the Germans and Latinized Europeans was a
medley of Slav tribes and Turkish peoples.  Prominent among
these were the Magyars or Hungarians who were coming westward
throughout the eighth and ninth centuries.  Charlemagne held
them for a time, but after his death they established
themselves in what is now Hungary; and after the fashion of
their kindred predecessors, the Huns, raided every summer
into the settled parts of Europe.  In 938 they went through
Germany into France, crossed the Alps into North Italy, and
so came home, burning, robbing and destroying.
</p>

<p>
Finally pounding away from the south at the vestiges of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P264"></a>264}</span>Roman
Empire were the Saracens.  They had made themselves largely
masters of the sea; their only formidable adversaries upon
the water were the Northmen, the Russian Northmen out of the
Black Sea and the Northmen of the west.

<p>
Hemmed in by these more vigorous and aggressive peoples,
amidst forces they did not understand and dangers they could
not estimate, Charlemagne and after him a series of other
ambitious spirits took up the futile drama of restoring the
Western Empire under the name of the Holy Roman Empire.  From
the time of Charlemagne onward this idea obsessed the
political life of Western Europe, while in the East the Greek
half of the Roman power decayed and dwindled until at last
nothing remained of it at all but the corrupt trading city of
Constantinople and a few miles of territory about it.
  Politically the continent of Europe remained traditional and
uncreative from the time of Charlemagne onward for a thousand
years.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P265"></a>265}</span>The name
of Charlemagne looms large in European history but his
personality is but indistinctly seen.  He could not read nor
write, but he had a considerable respect for learning; he
liked to be read aloud to at meals and he had a weakness for
theological discussion.  At his winter quarters at Aix-la-
Chapelle or Mayence he gathered about him a number of learned
men and picked up much from their conversation.  In the
summer he made war, against the Spanish Saracens, against the
Slavs and Magyars, against the Saxons, and other still
heathen German tribes.  It is doubtful whether the idea of
becoming C&#230;sar in succession to Romulus Augustulus
occurred to him before his acquisition of North Italy, or
whether it was suggested to him by Pope Leo III, who was
anxious to make the Latin Church independent of
Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
There were the most extraordinary man&#339;uvres at Rome
between the Pope and the prospective emperor in order to make
it appear or not appear as if the Pope gave him the imperial
crown.  The Pope succeeded in crowning his visitor and
conqueror by surprise in St. Peter&rsquo;s on Christmas Day
800 <small>A.D.</small>  He produced a crown, put it
on the head of Charlemagne and hailed him C&#230;sar and
Augustus.  There was great applause among the people.
  Charlemagne was by no means pleased at the way in which the
thing was done, it rankled in his mind as a defeat; and he
left the most careful instructions to his son that he was not
to let the Pope crown him emperor; he was to seize the crown
into his own hands and put it on his own head himself.  So at
the very outset of this imperial revival we see beginning the
age-long dispute of Pope and Emperor for priority.  But Louis
the Pious, the son of Charlemagne, disregarded his
father&rsquo;s instructions and was entirely submissive to
the Pope.
</p>

<p>
The empire of Charlemagne fell apart at the death of Louis
the Pious and the split between the French-speaking Franks
and the German-speaking Franks widened.  The next emperor to
arise was Otto, the son of a certain Henry the Fowler, a
Saxon, who had been elected King of Germany by an assembly of
German princes and prelates in 919.  Otto descended upon Rome
and was crowned emperor there in 962.  This Saxon line came
to an end early in the eleventh century and gave place to
other German rulers.  The feudal princes and nobles to the
west who spoke various French dialects <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P266"></a>266}</span>did not fall
under the sway of these German emperors after the
Carlovingian line, the line that is descended from
Charlemagne, had come to an end, and no part of Britain ever
came into the Holy Roman Empire.  The Duke of Normandy, the
King of France and a number of lesser feudal rulers remained
outside.  In 987 the Kingdom of France passed out of the
possession of the Carlovingian line into the hands of Hugh
Capet, whose descendants were still reigning in the
eighteenth century.  At the time of Hugh Capet the King of
France ruled only a comparatively small territory round
Paris.

<p>
In 1066 England was attacked almost simultaneously by an
invasion of the Norwegian Northmen under King Harold Hardrada
and by the Latinized Northmen under the Duke of Normandy.
  Harold King of England defeated the former at the battle of
Stamford Bridge, and was defeated by the latter at Hastings.
  England was conquered by the Normans, and so cut off from
Scandinavian, Teutonic and Russian affairs, and brought into
the most intimate relations and conflicts with the French.
  For the next four centuries the English were entangled in the
conflicts of the French feudal princes and wasted upon the
fields of France.

IT is interesting to note that Charlemagne corresponded with
the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, the Haroun-al-Raschid of the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>.  It is recorded that Haroun-al-Raschid
sent ambassadors from Bagdad&#8212;which had now replaced
Damascus as the Moslem capital&#8212;with a splendid tent, a
water clock, an elephant and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre.
  This latter present was admirably calculated to set the
Byzantine Empire and this new Holy Roman Empire by the ears
as to which was the proper protector of the Christians in
Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
These presents remind us that while Europe in the ninth
century was still a weltering disorder of war and pillage,
there flourished a great Arab Empire in Egypt and
Mesopotamia, far more civilized than anything Europe could
show.  Here literature and science still lived; the arts
flourished, and the mind of man could move without fear or
superstition.  And even in Spain and North Africa where the
Saracenic dominions were falling into political confusion
there was a vigorous intellectual life.  Aristotle was read
and discussed by these Jews and Arabs during these centuries
of European darkness.  They guarded the neglected seeds of
science and philosophy.
</p>

<p>
North-east of the Caliph&rsquo;s dominions was a number of
Turkish tribes.  They had been converted to Islam, and they
held the faith much more simply and fiercely than the
actively intellectual Arabs and Persians to the south.  In
the tenth century the Turks were growing strong and vigorous
while the Arab power was divided and decaying.  The relations
of the Turks to the Empire of the Caliphate became very
similar to the relations of the Medes to the last Babylonian
Empire fourteen centuries before.  In the eleventh century a
group of Turkish tribes, the Seljuk Turks, came down into
Mesopotamia and made the Caliph their nominal ruler but
really their <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P268"></a>268}</span>captive and tool.  They conquered
Armenia.  Then they struck at the remnants of the Byzantine
power in Asia Minor.  In 1071 the Byzantine army was utterly
smashed at the battle of Melasgird, and the Turks swept
forward until not a trace of Byzantine rule remained in Asia.
  They took the fortress of Nic&#230;a over against
Constantinople, and prepared to attempt that city.
</p>

<p>
The Byzantine emperor, Michael VII, was overcome with terror.
  He was already heavily engaged in warfare with a band of
Norman adventurers who had seized Durazzo, and with a fierce
Turkish people, the Petschenegs, who were raiding over the
Danube.  In his extremity he sought help where he could, and
it is notable that he did not appeal to the western emperor
but to the Pope of Rome as the head of Latin Christendom.  He
wrote to Pope Gregory VII, and his successor Alexius Comnenus
wrote still more urgently to Urban II.

This was not a quarter of a century from the rupture of the
Latin and Greek churches.  That controversy was still vividly
alive in men&rsquo;s minds, and this disaster to Byzantium
must have presented itself to the Pope as a supreme
opportunity for reasserting the supremacy of the Latin Church
over the dissentient Greeks.  Moreover this occasion gave the
Pope a chance to deal with two other matters that troubled
western Christendom very greatly.  One was the custom of
&ldquo;private war&rdquo; which disordered social life, and
the other was the superabundant fighting energy of the Low
Germans and Christianized Northmen and particularly of the
Franks and Normans.  A religious war, the Crusade, the War of
the Cross, was <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P269"></a>269}</span>preached against the Turkish
captors of Jerusalem, and a truce to all warfare amongst
Christians (1095).  The declared object of this war was the
recovery of the Holy Sepulchre from the unbelievers.  A man
called Peter the Hermit carried on a popular propaganda
throughout France and Germany on broadly democratic lines.
  He went clad in a coarse garment, barefooted on an ass, he
carried a huge cross and harangued the crowd in street or
market-place or church.  He denounced the cruelties practised
upon the Christian pilgrims by the Turks, and the shame of
the Holy Sepulchre being in any but Christian hands.  The
fruits of centuries of Christian teaching became apparent in
the response.  A great wave of enthusiasm swept the western
world, and popular Christendom discovered itself.

Such a widespread uprising of the common people in relation
to a single idea as now occurred was a new thing in the
history of our race.  There is nothing to parallel it in the
previous history of the <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P270"></a>270}</span>Roman Empire or of India or China.
  On a smaller scale, however, there had been similar movements
among the Jewish people after their liberation from the
Babylonian captivity, and later on Islam was to display a
parallel susceptibility to collective feeling.  Such
movements were certainly connected with the new spirit that
had come into life with the development of the missionary-
teaching religions.  The Hebrew prophets, Jesus and his
disciples, Mani, Muhammad, were all exhorters of men&rsquo;s
individual souls.  They brought the personal conscience face
to face with God.  Before that time religion had been much
more a business of fetish, of pseudoscience, than of
conscience.  The old kind of religion turned upon temple,
initiated priest and mystical sacrifice, and ruled the common
man like a slave by fear.  The new kind of religion made a
man of him.
</p>

<p>
The preaching of the First Crusade was the first stirring of
the common people in European history.  It may be too much to
call it the birth of modern democracy, but certainly at that
time modern democracy stirred.  Before very long we shall
find it stirring again, and raising the most disturbing
social and religious questions.
</p>

<p>
Certainly this first stirring of democracy ended very
pitifully and lamentably.  Considerable bodies of common
people, crowds rather than armies, set out eastward from
France and the Rhineland and Central Europe without waiting
for leaders or proper equipment to rescue the Holy Sepulchre.
  This was the &ldquo;people&rsquo;s crusade.&rdquo;  Two great
mobs blundered into Hungary, mistook the recently converted
Magyars for pagans, committed atrocities and were massacred.
  A third multitude with a similarly confused mind, after a
great pogrom of the Jews in the Rhineland, marched eastward,
and was also destroyed in Hungary.  Two other huge crowds,
under the leadership of Peter the Hermit himself, reached
Constantinople, crossed the Bosphorus, and were massacred
rather than defeated by the Seljuk Turks.  So began and ended
this first movement of the European people, as people.
</p>

<p>
Next year (1097) the real fighting forces crossed the
Bosphorus.  Essentially they were Norman in leadership and
spirit.  They stormed Nic&#230;a, marched by much the same
route as Alexander had followed fourteen centuries before, to
Antioch.  The siege of Antioch <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P271"></a>271}</span>kept them a year, and in June 1099
they invested Jerusalem.  It was stormed after a
month&rsquo;s siege.  The slaughter was terrible.  Men riding
on horseback were splashed by the blood in the streets.  At
nightfall on July 15th the Crusaders had fought their way
into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and overcome all
opposition there: blood-stained, weary and &ldquo;sobbing
from excess of joy&rdquo; they knelt down in prayer.

<p>
Immediately the hostility of Latin and Greek broke out again.
  The Crusaders were the servants of the Latin Church, and the
Greek patriarch of Jerusalem found himself in a far worse
case under the triumphant Latins than under the Turks.  The
Crusaders discovered themselves between Byzantine and Turk
and fighting both.  Much of Asia Minor was recovered by the
Byzantine Empire, and the Latin princes were left, a buffer
between Turk and Greek, with Jerusalem and a few small
principalities, of which Edessa was one of the chief, in
Syria.  Their grip even on these possessions was precarious,
and in 1144 Edessa fell to the Moslim, leading to an
ineffective Second Crusade, which failed to recover Edessa
but saved Antioch from a similar fate.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P272"></a>272}</span>In 1169
the forces of Islam were rallied under a Kurdish adventurer
named Saladin who had made himself master of Egypt.  He
preached a Holy War against the Christians, recaptured
Jerusalem in 1187, and so provoked the Third Crusade.  This
failed to recover Jerusalem.  In the Fourth Crusade (1202-4)
the Latin Church turned frankly upon the Greek Empire, and
there was not even a pretence of fighting the Turks.  It
started from Venice and in 1204 it stormed Constantinople.
  The great rising trading city of Venice was the leader in
this adventure, and most of the coasts and islands of the
Byzantine Empire were annexed by the Venetians.  A
&ldquo;Latin&rdquo; emperor (Baldwin of Flanders) was set up
in Constantinople and the Latin and Greek Church were
declared to be reunited.  The Latin emperors ruled in
Constantinople from 1204 to 1261 when the Greek world shook
itself free again from Roman predominance.
</p>

<p>
The twelfth century then and the opening of the thirteenth
was the age of papal ascendancy just as the eleventh was the
age of the ascendancy of the Seljuk Turks and the tenth the
age of the Northmen.  A united Christendom under the rule of
the Pope came nearer to being a working reality than it ever
was before or after that time.

<p>
In those centuries a simple Christian faith was real and
widespread over great areas of Europe.  Rome itself had
passed through some dark and discreditable phases; few
writers can be found to excuse the lives of Popes John XI and
John XII in the tenth century; they were abominable
creatures; but the heart and body of Latin Christendom had
remained earnest and simple; the generality of the common
priests and monks and nuns had lived exemplary and faithful
lives.  Upon the wealth of confidence such lives created
rested the power of the church.  Among the great Popes of the
past had been Gregory the Great, Gregory I (590-604) and Leo
III (795-816) who invited Charlemagne to be C&#230;sar and
crowned him in spite of himself.  Towards the close of the
eleventh century there arose a great clerical statesman,
Hildebrand, who ended his life as Pope Gregory VII (1073-
1085).  Next but one after him came Urban II (1087-1099), the
Pope of the First Crusade.  These two were the founders of
this period of papal greatness during which the Popes lorded
it over the Emperors.  From Bulgaria to Ireland and <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P274"></a>274}</span>from Norway to
Sicily and Jerusalem the Pope was supreme.  Gregory VII
obliged the Emperor Henry IV to come in penitence to him at
Canossa and to await forgiveness for three days and nights in
the courtyard of the castle, clad in sackcloth and barefooted
to the snow.  In 1176 at Venice the Emperor Frederick
(Frederick Barbarossa), knelt to Pope Alexander III and swore
fealty to him.
</p>

<p>
The great power of the church in the beginning of the
eleventh century lay in the wills and consciences of men.  It
failed to retain the moral prestige on which its power was
based.  In the opening decades of the fourteenth century it
was discovered that the power of the Pope had evaporated.
  What was it that destroyed the naive confidence of the common
people of Christendom in the church so that they would no
longer rally to its appeal and serve its purposes?
</p>

<p>
The first trouble was certainly the accumulation of wealth by
the church.  The church never died, and there was a frequent
disposition on the part of dying childless people to leave
lands to the church.  Penitent sinners were exhorted to do
so.  Accordingly in many European countries as much as a
fourth of the land became church property.  The appetite for
property grows with what it feeds upon.  Already in the
thirteenth century it was being said everywhere that the
priests were not good men, that they were always hunting for
money and legacies.
</p>

<p>
The kings and princes disliked this alienation of property
very greatly.  In the place of feudal lords capable of
military support, they found their land supporting abbeys and
monks and nuns.  And these lands were really under foreign
dominion.  Even before the time of Pope Gregory VII there had
been a struggle between the princes and the papacy over the
question of &ldquo;investitures,&rdquo; the question that is
of who should appoint the bishops.  If that power rested with
the Pope and not the King, then the latter lost control not
only of the consciences of his subjects but of a considerable
part of his dominions.  For also the clergy claimed exemption
from taxation.  They paid their taxes to Rome.  And not only
that, but the church also claimed the right to levy a tax of
one-tenth upon the property of the layman in addition to the
taxes he paid his prince.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P275"></a>275}</span>The
history of nearly every country in Latin Christendom tells of
the same phase in the eleventh century, a phase of struggle
between monarch and Pope on the issue of investitures and
generally it tells of a victory for the Pope.  He claimed to
be able to excommunicate the prince, to absolve his subjects
from their allegiance to him, to recognize a successor.  He
claimed to be able to put a nation under an interdict, and
then nearly all priestly functions ceased except the
sacraments of baptism, confirmation and penance; the priests
could neither hold the ordinary services, marry people, nor
bury the dead.  With these two weapons it was possible for
the twelfth century Popes to curb the most recalcitrant
princes and overawe the most restive peoples.  These were
enormous powers, and enormous powers are only to be used on
extraordinary occasions.  The Popes used them at last with a
frequency that staled their effect.  Within thirty years at
the end of the twelfth century we find Scotland, France and
England in turn under an interdict.  And also the Popes could
not resist the temptation to preach crusades against
offending princes&#8212;until the crusading spirit was
extinct.
</p>

<p>
It is possible that if the Church of Rome had struggled
simply against the princes and had had a care to keep its
hold upon the general mind, it might have achieved a
permanent dominion over all Christendom.  But the high claims
of the Pope were reflected as arrogance in the conduct of the
clergy.  Before the eleventh century the Roman priests could
marry; they had close ties with the people among whom they
lived; they were indeed a part of the people.  Gregory VII
made them celibates; he cut the priests off from too great an
intimacy with the laymen in order to bind them more closely
to Rome, but indeed he opened a fissure between the church
and the commonalty.  The church had its own law courts.
  Cases involving not merely priests but monks, students,
crusaders, widows, orphans and the helpless were reserved for
the clerical courts, and so were all matters relating to
wills, marriages and oaths and all cases of sorcery, heresy
and blasphemy.  Whenever the layman found himself in conflict
with the priest he had to go to a clerical court.  The
obligations of peace and war fell upon his shoulders alone
and left the priest free.  It is no great wonder that
jealousy and hatred of the priests grew up in the Christian
world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P276"></a>276}</span>Never
did Rome seem to realize that its power was in the
consciences of common men.  It fought against religious
enthusiasm, which should have been its ally, and it forced
doctrinal orthodoxy upon honest doubt and aberrant opinion.
  When the church interfered in matters of morality it had the
common man with it, but not when it interfered in matters of
doctrine.  When in the south of France Waldo taught a return
to the simplicity of Jesus in faith and life, Innocent III
preached a crusade against the Waldenses, Waldo&rsquo;s
followers, and permitted them to be suppressed with fire,
sword, rape and the most abominable cruelties.  When again
St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) taught the imitation of
Christ and a life of poverty and service, his followers, the
Franciscans, were persecuted, scourged, imprisoned and
dispersed.  In 1318 four of them were burnt alive at
Marseilles.  On the other hand the fiercely orthodox order of
the Dominicans, founded by St. Dominic (1170-1221) was
strongly supported by Innocent III, who with its assistance
set up an organization, the Inquisition, for the hunting of
heresy and the affliction of free thought.
</p>

<p>
So it was that the church by excessive claims, by unrighteous
privileges, and by an irrational intolerance destroyed that
free faith of the common man which was the final source of
all its power.  The story of its decline tells of no adequate
foemen from without but continually of decay from within.

<p>

ONE very great weakness of the Roman Church in its struggle
to secure the headship of all Christendom was the manner in
which the Pope was chosen.
</p>

<p>
If indeed the papacy was to achieve its manifest ambition and
establish one rule and one peace throughout Christendom, then
it was vitally necessary that it should have a strong, steady
and continuous direction.  In those great days of its
opportunity it needed before all things that the Popes when
they took office should be able men in the prime of life,
that each should have his successor-designate with whom he
could discuss the policy of the church, and that the forms
and processes of election should be clear, definite,
unalterable and unassailable.  Unhappily none of these things
obtained.  It was not even clear who could vote in the
election of a Pope, nor whether the Byzantine or Holy Roman
Emperor had a voice in the matter.  That very great papal
statesman Hildebrand (Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085) did much
to regularize the election.  He confined the votes to the
Roman cardinals and he reduced the Emperor&rsquo;s share to a
formula of assent conceded to him by the church, but he made
no provision for a successor-designate and he left it
possible for the disputes of the cardinals to keep the See
vacant, as in some cases it was kept vacant, for a year or
more.

<p>
The consequences of this want of firm definition are to be
seen in the whole history of the papacy up to the sixteenth
century.  From quite early times onward there were disputed
elections and two or more men each claiming to be Pope.  The
church would then be subjected to the indignity of going to
the Emperor or some other outside arbiter to settle the
dispute.  And the career of everyone of the great Popes ended
in a note of interrogation.  At his death the church might be
left headless and as ineffective as a decapitated <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P279"></a>279}</span>body.  Or he
might be replaced by some old rival eager only to discredit
and undo his work.  Or some enfeebled old man tottering on
the brink of the grave might succeed him.
</p>

<p>
It was inevitable that this peculiar weakness of the papal
organization should attract the interference of the various
German princes, the French King, and the Norman and French
Kings who ruled in England; that they should all try to
influence the elections, and have a Pope in their own
interest established in the Lateran Palace at Rome.  And the
more powerful and important the Pope became in European
affairs, the more urgent did these interventions become.
  Under the circumstances it is no great wonder that many of
the Popes were weak and futile.  The astonishing thing is
that many of them were able and courageous men.
</p>

<p>
One of the most vigorous and interesting of the Popes of this
great period was Innocent III (1198-1216) who was so
fortunate as to become Pope before he was thirty-eight.  He
and his successors were pitted against an even more
interesting personality, the Emperor Frederick II; <i>Stupor
mundi</i> he was called, the Wonder of the world.  The
struggle of this monarch against Rome is a turning place in
history.  In the end Rome defeated him and destroyed his
dynasty, but he left the prestige of the church and Pope so
badly wounded that its wounds festered and led to its decay.
</p>

<p>
Frederick was the son of the Emperor Henry VI and his mother
was the daughter of Roger I, the Norman King of Sicily.  He
inherited this kingdom in 1198 when he was a child of four
years.  Innocent III had been made his guardian.  Sicily in
those days had been but recently conquered by the Normans;
the Court was half oriental and full of highly educated
Arabs; and some of these were associated in the education of
the young king.  No doubt they were at some pains to make
their point of view clear to him.  He got a Moslem view of
Christianity as well as a Christian view of Islam, and the
unhappy result of this double system of instruction was a
view, exceptional in that age of faith, that all religions
were impostures.  He talked freely on the subject; his
heresies and blasphemies are on record.
</p>

<p>
As the young man grew up he found himself in conflict with
his guardian.  Innocent III wanted altogether too much from
his ward.  <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P280"></a>280}</span>When the opportunity came for
Frederick to succeed as Emperor, the Pope intervened with
conditions.  Frederick must promise to put down heresy in
Germany with a strong hand. Moreover he must relinquish his
crown in Sicily and South Italy, because otherwise he would
be too strong for the Pope.  And the German clergy were to be
freed from all taxation.  Frederick agreed but with no
intention of keeping his word.  The Pope had already induced
the French King to make war upon his own subjects in France,
the cruel and bloody crusade against the Waldenses; he wanted
Frederick to do the same thing in Germany.  But Frederick
being far more of a heretic than any of the simple pietists
who had incurred the Pope&rsquo;s animosity, lacked the
crusading impulse.  And when Innocent urged him to crusade
against the Moslim and recover Jerusalem he was equally ready
to promise and equally slack in his performance.

<p>
Having secured the imperial crown Frederick II stayed in
Sicily, which he greatly preferred to Germany as a residence,
and did nothing to redeem any of his promises to Innocent
III, who died baffled in 1216.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P281"></a>281}</span>Honorius
III, who succeeded Innocent, could do no better with
Frederick, and Gregory IX (1227) came to the papal throne
evidently resolved to settle accounts with this young man at
any cost.  He excommunicated him.  Frederick II was denied
all the comforts of religion.  In the half-Arab Court of
Sicily this produced singularly little discomfort.  And also
the Pope addressed a public letter to the Emperor reciting
his vices (which were indisputable), his heresies, and his
general misconduct.  To this Frederick replied in a document
of diabolical ability.  It was addressed to all the princes
of Europe, and it made the first clear statement of the issue
between the Pope and the princes.  He made a shattering
attack upon the manifest ambition of the Pope to become the
absolute ruler of all Europe.  He suggested a union of
princes against this usurpation.   He directed the attention
of the princes specifically to the wealth of the church.
</p>

<p>
Having fired off this deadly missile Frederick resolved to
perform his twelve-year-old promise and go upon a crusade.
  This was the Sixth Crusade (1228).  It was as a crusade,
farcical.  Frederick II went to Egypt and met and discussed
affairs with the Sultan.  These two gentlemen, both of
sceptical opinions, exchanged congenial views, made a
commercial convention to their mutual advantage, and agreed
to transfer Jerusalem to Frederick.  This indeed was a new
sort of crusade, a crusade by private treaty.  Here was no
blood splashing the conqueror, no &ldquo;weeping with excess
of joy.&rdquo;  As this astonishing crusader was an
excommunicated man, he had to be content with a purely
secular coronation as King of Jerusalem, taking the crown
from the altar with his own hand&#8212;for all the clergy
were bound to shun him.  He then returned to Italy, chased
the papal armies which had invaded his dominions back to
their own territories, and obliged the Pope to grant him
absolution from his excommunication.  So a prince might treat
the Pope in the thirteenth century, and there was now no
storm of popular indignation to avenge him.  Those days were
past.
</p>

<p>
In 1239 Gregory IX resumed his struggle with Frederick,
excommunicated him for a second time, and renewed that
warfare of public abuse in which the papacy had already
suffered severely.  The controversy was revived after Gregory
IX was dead, when Innocent IV <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P282"></a>282}</span>was Pope; and again a devastating
letter, which men were bound to remember, was written by
Frederick against the church.  He denounced the pride and
irreligion of the clergy, and ascribed all the corruptions of
the time to their pride and wealth.  He proposed to his
fellow princes a general confiscation of church
property&#8212;for the good of the church.  It was a
suggestion that never afterwards left the imagination of the
European princes.
</p>

<p>
We will not go on to tell of his last years.  The particular
events of his life are far less significant than its general
atmosphere.  It is possible to piece together something of
his court life in Sicily.  He was luxurious in his way of
living, and fond of beautiful things.  He is described as
licentious.  But it is clear that he was a man of very
effectual curiosity and inquiry.  He gathered Jewish and
Moslem as well as Christian philosophers at his court, and he
did much to irrigate the Italian mind with Saracenic
influences.  Through him the Arabic numerals and algebra were
introduced to Christian students, and among other
philosophers at his court was Michael Scott, who translated
portions of Aristotle and the commentaries thereon of the
great Arab philosopher Averroes (of Cordoba).  In 1224
Frederick founded the University of Naples, and he enlarged
and enriched the great medical school at Salerno University.
  He also founded a zoological garden.  He left a book on
hawking, which shows him to have been an acute observer of
the habits of birds, and he was one of the first Italians to
write Italian verse.  Italian poetry was indeed born at his
court.  He has been called by an able writer, &ldquo;the
first of the moderns,&rdquo; and the phrase expresses aptly
the unprejudiced detachment of his intellectual side.
</p>

<p>
A still more striking intimation of the decay of the living
and sustaining forces of the papacy appeared when presently
the Popes came into conflict with the growing power of the
French King.  During the lifetime of the Emperor Frederick
II, Germany fell into disunion, and the French King began to
play the r&#244;le of guard, supporter and rival to the Pope
that had hitherto fallen to the Hohenstaufen Emperors.  A
series of Popes pursued the policy of supporting the French
monarchs.  French princes were established in the kingdom of
Sicily and Naples, with the support and approval of Rome, and
the French Kings saw before them the possibility <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P283"></a>283}</span>of restoring
and ruling the Empire of Charlemagne.  When, however, the
German interregnum after the death of Frederick II, the last
of the Hohenstaufens, came to all end and Rudolf of Habsburg
was elected first Habsburg Emperor (1273), the policy of Rome
began to fluctuate between France and Germany, veering about
with the sympathies of each successive Pope.  In the East in
1261 the Greeks recaptured Constantinople from the Latin
emperors, and the founder of the new Greek dynasty, Michael
Pal&#230;ologus, Michael VIII, after some unreal tentatives
of reconciliation with the Pope, broke away from the Roman
communion altogether, and with that, and the fall of the
Latin kingdoms in Asia, the eastward ascendancy of the Popes
came to an end.

In 1294 Boniface VIII became Pope.  He was an Italian,
hostile to the French, and full of a sense of the great
traditions and mission of Rome.  For a time he carried things
with a high hand.  In 1300 he held a jubilee, and a vast
multitude of pilgrims assembled in Rome.  &ldquo;So great was
the influx of money into the papal treasury, that two
assistants were kept busy with the rakes collecting the <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P284"></a>284}</span>offerings that
were deposited at the tomb of St. Peter.&rdquo; [<a
name="chapXLVIIfn1text"></a><a href="#chapXLVIIfn1">1</a>]
But this festival was a delusive triumph.  Boniface came into
conflict with the French King in 1302, and in 1303, as he was
about to pronounce sentence of excommunication against that
monarch, he was surprised and arrested in his own ancestral
palace at Anagni, by Guillaume de Nogaret.  This agent from
the French King forced an entrance into the palace, made his
way into the bedroom of the frightened Pope&#8212;he was
lying in bed with a cross in his hands&#8212;and heaped
threats and insults upon him.  The Pope was liberated a day
or so later by the townspeople, and returned to Rome; but
there he was seized upon and again made prisoner by the
Orsini family, and in a few weeks&rsquo; time the shocked and
disillusioned old man died a prisoner in their hands.

<p>
The people of Anagni did resent the first outrage, and rose
against Nogaret to liberate Boniface, but then Anagni was the
Pope&rsquo;s native town.  The important point to note is
that the French King <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P285"></a>285}</span>in this rough treatment of the
head of Christendom was acting with the full approval of his
people; he had summoned a council of the Three Estates of
France (lords, church and commons) and gained their consent
before proceeding to extremities.  Neither in Italy, Germany
nor England was there the slightest general manifestation of
disapproval at this free handling of the sovereign pontiff.
  The idea of Christendom had decayed until its power over the
minds of men had gone.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the fourteenth century the papacy did nothing to
recover its moral sway.  The next Pope elected, Clement V,
was a Frenchman, the choice of King Philip of France.  He
never came to Rome.  He set up his court in the town of
Avignon, which then belonged not to France but to the papal
See, though embedded in French territory, and there his
successors remained until 1377, when Pope Gregory XI returned
to the Vatican palace in Rome.  But Gregory XI did not take
the sympathies of the whole church with him.  Many of the
cardinals were of French origin and their habits and
associations were rooted deep at Avignon.  When in 1378
Gregory XI died, and an Italian, Urban VI, was elected, these
dissentient cardinals declared the election invalid, and
elected another Pope, the anti-Pope, Clement VII.  This split
is called the Great Schism.  The Popes remained in Rome, and
all the anti-French powers, the Emperor, the King of England,
Hungary, Poland and the North of Europe were loyal to them.
  The anti-Popes, on the other hand, continued in Avignon, and
were supported by the King of France, his ally the King of
Scotland, Spain, Portugal and various German princes.  Each
Pope excommunicated and cursed the adherents of his rival
(1378-1417).
</p>

<p>
Is it any wonder that presently all over Europe people began
to think for themselves in matters of religion?
</p>

<p>
The beginnings of the Franciscans and the Dominicans, which
we have noted in the preceding chapters, were but two among
many of the new forces that were arising in Christendom,
either to hold or shatter the church as its own wisdom might
decide.
  Those two orders the church did assimilate and use, though
with a little violence in the case of the former.  But other
forces were more frankly disobedient and critical.  A century
and a half later <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P286"></a>286}</span>came Wycliffe (1320-1384). He was
a learned Doctor at Oxford.  Quite late in his life he began
a series of outspoken criticisms of the corruption of the
clergy and the unwisdom of the church.  He organized a number
of poor priests, the Wycliffites, to spread his ideas
throughout England; and in order that people should judge
between the church and himself, he translated the Bible into
English.  He was a more learned and far abler man than either
St. Francis or St. Dominic.  He had supporters in high places
and a great following among the people; and though Rome raged
against him, and ordered his imprisonment, he died a free
man.  But the black and ancient spirit that was leading the
Catholic Church to its destruction would not let his bones
rest in the grave.  By a decree of the Council of Constance
in 1415, his remains were ordered to be dug up and burnt, an
order which was carried out at the command of Pope Martin V
by Bishop Fleming in 1428.  This desecration was not the act
of some isolated fanatic; it was the official act of the
church.

<h4 align="center">THE MONGOL CONQUESTS</h4>

<p>

BUT in the thirteenth century, while this strange and finally
ineffectual struggle to unify Christendom under the rule of
the Pope was going on in Europe, far more momentous events
were afoot upon the larger stage of Asia.  A Turkish people
from the country to the north of China rose suddenly to
prominence in the world&rsquo;s affairs, and achieved such a
series of conquests as has no parallel in history.  These
were the Mongols.  At the opening of the thirteenth century
they were a horde of nomadic horsemen, living very much as
their predecessors, the Huns, had done, subsisting chiefly
upon meat and mare&rsquo;s milk and living in tents of skin.
  They had shaken themselves free from Chinese dominion, and
brought a number of other Turkish tribes into a military
confederacy.  Their central camp was at Karakorum in
Mongolia.
</p>

<p>
At this time China was in a state of division.  The great
dynasty of Tang had passed into decay by the tenth century,
and after a phase of division into warring states, three main
empires, that of Kin in the north with Pekin as its capital
and that of Sung in the south with a capital at Nankin, and
Hsia in the centre, remain.  In 1214 Jengis Khan, the leader
of the Mongol confederates, made war on the Kin Empire and
captured Pekin (1214).  He then turned westward and conquered
Western Turkestan, Persia, Armenia, India down to Lahore, and
South Russia as far as Kieff.  He died master of a vast
empire that reached from the Pacific to the Dnieper.
</p>

<p>
His successor, Ogdai Khan, continued this astonishing career
of conquest.  His armies were organized to a very high level
of efficiency; and they had with them a new Chinese
invention, gunpowder, which they used in small field guns.
  He completed the conquest of the Kin Empire and then swept
his hosts right across Asia to Russia (1235), an altogether
amazing march.  Kieff was <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P288"></a>288}</span>destroyed in 1240, and nearly all
Russia became tributary to the Mongols.  Poland was ravaged,
and a mixed army of Poles and Germans was annihilated at the
battle of Liegnitz in Lower Silesia in 1241.  The Emperor
Frederick II does not seem to have made any great efforts to
stay the advancing tide.

</center>

<p>
&ldquo;It is only recently,&rdquo; says Bury in his notes to
Gibbon&rsquo;s <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>,
&ldquo;that European history has begun to understand that the
successes of the Mongol army which overran Poland and
occupied Hungary in the spring of
 <small>A.D.</small> 1241 were won by consummate strategy and were
not due to a mere overwhelming superiority of numbers.  But
this fact has not yet become a matter of common knowledge;
the vulgar opinion which represents the Tartars as a wild
horde carrying all before them solely by their multitude, and
galloping through Eastern Europe without a strategic plan,
rushing at all obstacles and overcoming them by mere weight,
still prevails. . . .
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was wonderful how punctually and effectually the
arrangements were carried out in operations extending from
the Lower Vistula to Transylvania.  Such a campaign was quite
beyond the <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P289"></a>289}</span>power of any European army of the
time, and it was beyond the vision of any European commander.
  There was no general in Europe, from Frederick II downward,
who was not a tyro in strategy compared to Subutai.  It
should also be noticed that the Mongols embarked upon the
enterprise with full knowledge of the political situation of
Hungary and the condition of Poland&#8212;they had taken care
to inform themselves by a well-organized system of spies; on
the other hand, the Hungarians and the Christian powers, like
childish barbarians, knew hardly anything about their
enemies.&rdquo;
</p>

</center>

<p>
But though the Mongols were victorious at Liegnitz, they did
not continue their drive westward.  They were getting into
woodlands and hilly country, which did not suit their
tactics; and so they turned southward and prepared to settle
in Hungary, massacring or assimilating the kindred Magyar,
even as these had previously massacred and assimilated the
mixed Scythians and Avars and Huns before them.  From the
Hungarian plain they would probably have made raids west and
south as the Hungarians had done in the ninth century, the
Avars in the seventh and eighth and the Huns in the fifth.
  But Ogdai died suddenly, and in 1242 there was trouble <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P290"></a>290}</span>about the
succession, and recalled by this, the undefeated hosts of
Mongols began to pour back across Hungary and Roumania
towards the east.
</p>

<p>
Thereafter the Mongols concentrated their attention upon
their Asiatic conquests.  By the middle of the thirteenth
century they had conquered the Sung Empire.  Mangu Khan
succeeded Ogdai Khan as Great Khan in 1251, and made his
brother Kublai Khan governor of China.  In 1280 Kublai Khan
had been formally recognized Emperor of China, and so founded
the Yuan dynasty which lasted until 1368.  While the last
ruins of the Sung rule were going down in China, another
brother of Mangu, Hulagu, was conquering Persia and Syria.
  The Mongols displayed a bitter animosity to Islam at this
time, and not only massacred the population of Bagdad when
they captured that city, but set to work to destroy the
immemorial irrigation system which had kept Mesopotamia
incessantly prosperous and populous from the early days of
Sumeria.  From that time until our own Mesopotamia has been a
desert of ruins, sustaining only a scanty population.  Into
Egypt the Mongols never penetrated; the Sultan of Egypt
completely defeated an army of Hulagu&rsquo;s in Palestine in
1260.
</p>

<p>
After that disaster the tide of Mongol victory ebbed.  The
dominions of the Great Khan fell into a number of separate
states.  The eastern Mongols became Buddhists, like the
Chinese; the western became Moslim.  The Chinese threw off
the rule of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, and set up the native
Ming dynasty which flourished from 1368 to 1644.  The
Russians remained tributary to the Tartar hordes upon the
south-east steppes until 1480, when the Grand Duke of Moscow
repudiated his allegiance and laid the foundation of modern
Russia.

In the fourteenth century there was a brief revival of Mongol
vigour under Timurlane, a descendant of Jengis Khan.  He
established himself in Western Turkestan, assumed the title
of Grand Khan in 1369, and conquered from Syria to Delhi.  He
was the most savage and destructive of all the Mongol
conquerors.  He established an empire of desolation that did
not survive his death.  In 1505, however, a descendant of
this Timur, an adventurer named Baber, got together an army
with guns and swept down upon the <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P292"></a>292}</span>plains of India.  His grandson
Akbar (1556-1605) completed his conquests, and this Mongol
(or &ldquo;Mogul&rdquo; as the Arabs called it) dynasty ruled
in Delhi over the greater part of India until the eighteenth
century.

</center>

<p>
One of the consequences of the first great sweep of Mongol
conquest in the thirteenth century was to drive a certain
tribe of Turks, the Ottoman Turks, out of Turkestan into Asia
Minor.  They extended and consolidated their power in Asia
Minor, crossed the Dardanelles and conquered Macedonia,
Serbia and Bulgaria, until at last Constantinople remained
like an island amongst the Ottoman dominions.  In 1453 the
Ottoman Sultan, Muhammad II, took Constantinople, attacking
it from the European side with a great number of guns.  This
event caused intense excitement in Europe and there was talk
of a crusade, but the day of the crusades was past.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the sixteenth century the Ottoman Sultans
conquered Bagdad, Hungary, Egypt and most of North Africa,
and their fleet made them masters of the Mediterranean.  They
very nearly took Vienna, and they exacted it tribute from the
Emperor.  There were but two items to offset the general ebb
of Christian dominion <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P293"></a>293}</span>in the fifteenth century.  One was
the restoration of the independence of Moscow (1480); the
other was the gradual reconquest of Spain by the Christians.
  In 1492, Granada, the last Moslem state in the peninsula,
fell to King Ferdinand of Aragon and his Queen Isabella of
Castile.
</p>

<p>
But it was not until as late as 1571 that the naval battle of
Lepanto broke the prick of the Ottomans, and restored the
Mediterranean waters to Christian ascendancy.

<h4 align="center">THE INTELLECTUAL REVIVAL OF THE
EUROPEANS</h4>

<p>

THROUGHOUT the twelfth century there were many signs that the
European intelligence was recovering courage and leisure, and
preparing to take up again the intellectual enterprises of
the first Greek scientific enquiries and such speculations as
those of the Italian Lucretius.  The causes of this revival
were many and complex.  The suppression of private war, the
higher standards of comfort and security that followed the
crusades, and the stimulation of men&rsquo;s minds by the
experiences of these expeditions were no doubt necessary
preliminary conditions.  Trade was reviving; cities were
recovering ease and safety; the standard of education was
arising in the church and spreading among laymen.  The
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were a period of growing,
independent or quasi-independent cities; Venice, Florence,
Genoa, Lisbon, Paris, Bruges, London, Antwerp, Hamburg,
Nuremberg, Novgorod, Wisby and Bergen for example.  They were
all trading cities with many travellers, and where men trade
and travel they talk and think.  The polemics of the Popes
and princes, the conspicuous savagery and wickedness of the
persecution of heretics, were exciting men to doubt the
authority of the church and question and discuss fundamental
things.
</p>

<p>
We have seen how the Arabs were the means of restoring
Aristotle to Europe, and how such a prince as Frederick II
acted as a channel through which Arabic philosophy and
science played upon the renascent European mind.  Still more
influential in the stirring up of men&rsquo;s ideas were the
Jews.  Their very existence was a note of interrogation to
the claims of the church.  And finally the secret,
fascinating enquiries of the alchemists were spreading far
and wide and setting men to the petty, furtive and yet
fruitful resumption of experimental science.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P295"></a>295}</span>And the
stir in men&rsquo;s minds was by no means confined now to the
independent and well educated.  The mind of the common man
was awake in the world as it had never been before in all the
experience of mankind.  In spite of priest and persecution,
Christianity does seem to have carried a mental ferment
wherever its teaching reached.  It established a direct
relation between the conscience of the individual man and the
God of Righteousness, so that now if need arose he had the
courage to form his own judgment upon prince or prelate or
creed.
</p>

<p>
As early as the eleventh century philosophical discussion had
begun again in Europe, and there were great and growing
universities at Paris, Oxford, Bologna and other centres.
  There medieval &ldquo;schoolmen&rdquo; took up again and
thrashed out a series of questions upon the value and meaning
of words that were a necessary preliminary to clear thinking
in the scientific age that was to follow.  And standing by
himself because of his distinctive genius was Roger Bacon
(circa 1210 to circa 1293), a Franciscan of Oxford, the
father of modern experimental science.  His name deserves a
prominence in our history second only to that of Aristotle.
</p>

<p>
His writings are one long tirade against ignorance.  He told
his age it was ignorant, an incredibly bold thing to do.
  Nowadays a man may tell the world it is as silly as it is
solemn, that all its methods are still infantile and clumsy
and its dogmas childish assumptions, without much physical
danger; but these peoples of the middle ages when they were
not actually being massacred or starving or dying of
pestilence, were passionately convinced of the wisdom, the
completeness and finality of their beliefs, and disposed to
resent any reflections upon them very bitterly.  Roger
Bacon&rsquo;s writings were like a flash of light in a
profound darkness.  He combined his attack upon the ignorance
of his times with a wealth of suggestion for the increase of
knowledge.  In his passionate insistence upon the need of
experiment and of collecting knowledge, the spirit of
Aristotle lives again in him.  &ldquo;Experiment,
experiment,&rdquo; that is the burthen of Roger Bacon.
</p>

<p>
Yet of Aristotle himself Roger Bacon fell foul.  He fell foul
of him because men, instead of facing facts boldly, sat in
rooms and pored over the bad Latin translations which were
then all that was <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P296"></a>296}</span>available of the master.
  &ldquo;If I had my way,&rdquo; he wrote, in his intemperate
fashion, &ldquo;I should burn all the books of Aristotle, for
the study of them can only lead to a loss of time, produce
error, and increase ignorance,&rdquo; a sentiment that
Aristotle would probably have echoed could he have returned
to a world in which his works were not so much read as
worshipped&#8212;and that, as Roger Bacon showed, in these
most abominable translations.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P297"></a>297}</span>Throughout his books, a little
disguised by the necessity of seeming to square it all with
orthodoxy for fear of the prison and worse, Roger Bacon
shouted to mankind, &ldquo;Cease to be ruled by dogmas and
authorities; <i>look at the world!</i>&rdquo; Four chief
sources of ignorance he denounced; respect for authority,
custom, the sense of the ignorant crowd, and the vain, proud
unteachableness of our dispositions.  Overcome but these, and
a world of power would open to men: &#8212;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Machines for navigating are possible without rowers,
so that great ships suited to river or ocean, guided by one
man, may be borne with greater speed than if they were full
of men.  Likewise cars may be made so that without a draught
animal they may be moved <i>cum impetu in&#339;stimable</i>,
as we deem the scythed chariots to have been from which
antiquity fought.  And flying machines are possible, so that
a man may sit in the middle turning some device by which
artificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a flying
bird.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So Roger Bacon wrote, but three more centuries were to elapse
before men began any systematic attempts to explore the
hidden stores of power and interest he realized so clearly
existed beneath the dull surface of human affairs.
</p>

<p>
But the Saracenic world not only gave Christendom the
stimulus of its philosophers and alchemists; it also gave it
paper.  It is scarcely too much to say that paper made the
intellectual revival of Europe possible.  Paper originated in
China, where its use probably goes back to the second century
<small>B.C.</small>  In 751 the Chinese made an
attack upon the Arab Moslems in Samarkand; they were
repulsed, and among the prisoners taken from them were some
skilled papermakers, from whom the art was learnt.  Arabic
paper manuscripts from the ninth century onward still exist.
  The manufacture entered Christendom either through Greece or
by the capture of Moorish paper-mills during the Christian
reconquest of Spain.  But under the Christian Spanish the
product deteriorated sadly.  Good paper was not made in
Christian Europe until the end of the thirteenth century, and
then it was Italy which led the world.  Only by the
fourteenth century did the manufacture reach Germany, and not
until the end of that century was it abundant and <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P298"></a>298}</span>cheap enough
for the printing of books to be a practicable business
proposition.  Thereupon printing followed naturally and
necessarily, for printing is the most obvious of inventions,
and the intellectual life of the world entered upon a new and
far more vigorous phase.  It ceased to be a little trickle
from mind to mind; it became a broad flood, in which
thousands and presently scores and hundreds of thousands of
minds participated.
</p>

<p>
One immediate result of this achievement of printing was the
appearance of an abundance of Bibles in the world.  Another
was a cheapening of school-books.  The knowledge of reading
spread swiftly.  There was not only a great increase of books
in the world, but the books that were now made were plainer
to read and so easier to understand.  Instead of toiling at a
crabbed text arid then thinking over its significance,
readers now could think unimpeded as they read.  With this
increase in the facility of reading, the reading public grew.
  The book ceased to be a highly decorated toy or a
scholar&rsquo;s mystery.  People began to write books to be
read as well as looked at by ordinary people.  They wrote in
the ordinary language and not in Latin.  With the fourteenth
century the real history of the European literature begins.
</p>

<p>
So far we have been dealing only with the Saracenic share in
the European revival.  Let us turn now to the influence of
the Mongol conquests.  They stimulated the geographical
imagination of Europe enormously.  For a time under the Great
Khan, all Asia and Western Europe enjoyed an open
intercourse; all the roads were temporarily open, and
representatives of every nation appeared at the court of
Karakorum.  The barriers between Europe and Asia set up by
the religious feud of Christianity and Islam were lowered.
  Great hopes were entertained by the papacy for the conversion
of the Mongols to Christianity.  Their only religion so far
had been Shumanism, a primitive paganism.  Envoys of the
Pope, Buddhist priests from India, Parisian and Italian and
Chinese artificers, Byzantine and Armenian merchants, mingled
with Arab officials and Persian and Indian astronomers and
mathematicians at the Mongol court.  We hear too much in
history of the campaigns and massacres of the Mongols, and
not enough of their curiosity and desire for learning.  Not
perhaps as an originative people, but as transmitters <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P299"></a>299}</span>of knowledge
and method their influence upon the world&rsquo;s history has
been very great.  And everything one can learn of the vague
and romantic personalities of Jengis or Kublai tends to
confirm the impression that these men were at least as
understanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyant
but egotistical figure Alexander the Great or that raiser of
political ghosts, that energetic but illiterate theologian
Charlemagne.
</p>

<p>
One of the most interesting of these visitors to the Mongol
Court was a certain Venetian, Marco Polo, who afterwards set
down his story in a book.  He went to China about 1272 with
his father and uncle, who had already once made the journey.
  The Great Khan had been deeply impressed by the elder Polos;
they were the first men of the &ldquo;Latin&rdquo; peoples he
had seen; and he sent them back with enquiries for teachers
and learned men who could explain Christianity to him, and
for various other European things that had aroused his
curiosity.  Their visit with Marco was their second visit.

The three Polos started by way of Palestine and not by the
Crimea, as in their previous expedition.  They had with them
a gold tablet and other indications from the Great Khan that
must have greatly facilitated their journey.  The Great Khan
had asked for some oil from the lamp that burns in the Holy
Sepulchre at Jerusalem; and so thither they first went, and
then by way of Cilicia into Armenia.  They went thus far
north because the Sultan of Egypt was raiding the Mongol
domains at this time.  Thence they came by way of Mesopotamia
to Ormuz on the Persian Gulf, as if they contemplated a sea
voyage.  At Ormuz they met merchants from India.  For some
reason they did not take ship, but instead turned northward
through the Persian deserts, and so by way of Balkh over
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P300"></a>300}</span>the
Pamir to Kashgar, and by way of Kotan and the Lob Nor into
the Hwang-ho valley and on to Pekin.  At Pekin was the Great
Khan, and they were hospitably entertained.

Marco particularly pleased Kublai; he was young and clever,
and it is clear he had mastered the Tartar language very
thoroughly.  He was given an official position and sent on
several missions, chiefly in south-west China.  The tale he
had to tell of vast stretches of smiling and prosperous
country, &ldquo;all the way excellent hostelries for
travellers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;fine vineyards, fields, and
gardens,&rdquo; of &ldquo;many abbeys&rdquo; of Buddhist
monks, of manufactures of &ldquo;cloth of silk and gold and
many fine taffetas,&rdquo; a &ldquo;constant succession of
cities and boroughs,&rdquo; and so on, first roused the
incredulity and then fired the imagination of all Europe.  He
told of Burmah, and of its great armies with hundreds of
elephants, and how these animals were defeated by the Mongol
bowmen, and also of the Mongol conquest of Pegu.  He told of
Japan, and greatly exaggerated the amount of gold in that
country.  For three years Marco ruled the city of Yang-chow
as governor, and he probably impressed the Chinese
inhabitants as being little more of a foreigner than any
Tartar would have been.  He may also have been sent on a
mission to India.  Chinese records mention a certain Polo
attached to the imperial council in 1277, a very valuable
confirmation of the general truth of the Polo story.
</p>

<p>
The publication of Marco Polo&rsquo;s travels produced a
profound effect upon the European imagination.  The European
literature, and especially the European romance of the
fifteenth century, echoes with the names in Marco
Polo&rsquo;s story, with Cathay (North China) and Cambulac
(Pekin) and the like.

Two centuries later, among the readers of the Travels of
Marco Polo was a certain Genoese mariner, Christopher
Columbus, who <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P301"></a>301}</span>conceived the brilliant idea of
sailing westward round the world to China.  In Seville there
is a copy of the Travels with marginal notes by Columbus.
  There were many reasons why the thought of a Genoese should
be turned in this direction.  Until its capture by the Turks
in 1453 Constantinople had been an impartial trading mart
between the Western world and the East, and the Genoese had
traded there freely.  But the &ldquo;Latin&rdquo; Venetians,
the bitter rivals of the Genoese, had been the allies and
helpers of the Turks against the Greeks, and with the coming
of the Turks Constantinople turned an <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P302"></a>302}</span>unfriendly
face upon Genoese trade.  The long forgotten discovery that
the world was round had gradually resumed its sway over
men&rsquo;s minds.  The idea of going westward to China was
therefore a fairly obvious one.  It was encouraged by two
things.  The mariner&rsquo;s compass had now been invented
and men were no longer left to the mercy of a fine night and
the stars to determine the direction in which they were
sailing, and the Normans, Catalonians and Genoese and
Portuguese had already pushed out into the Atlantic as far as
the Canary Isles, Madeira and the Azores.
</p>

<p>
Yet Columbus found many difficulties before he could get
ships to put his idea to the test.  He went from one European
Court to another.  Finally at Granada, just won from the
Moors, he secured the patronage of Ferdinand and Isabella,
and was able to set out across the unknown ocean in three
small ships.  After a voyage of two months and nine days he
came to a land which he believed to be India, but which was
really a new continent, whose distinct existence the old
world had never hitherto suspected.  He returned to Spain
with gold, cotton, strange beasts and birds, and two wild-
eyed painted Indians to be baptized.  They were called
Indians because, to the end of his days, he believed that
this land he had found was India.  Only in the course of
several years did men begin to realize that the whole new
continent of America was added to the world&rsquo;s
resources.
</p>

<p>
The success of Columbus stimulated overseas enterprise
enormously.  In 1497 the Portuguese sailed round Africa to
India, and in 1515 there were Portuguese ships in Java.  In
1519 Magellan, a Portuguese sailor in Spanish employment,
sailed out of Seville westward with five ships, of which one,
the <i>Vittoria</i>, came back up the river to Seville in
1522, the first ship that had ever circumnavigated the world.
  Thirty-one men were aboard her, survivors of two-hundred-and-
eighty who had started.  Magellan himself had been killed in
the Philippine Isles.
</p>

<p>
Printed paper books, a new realization of the round world as
a thing altogether attainable, a new vision of strange lands,
strange animals and plants, strange manners and customs,
discoveries overseas and in the skies and in the ways and
materials of life burst upon the European mind. The Greek
classics, buried and forgotten for so <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P303"></a>303}</span>long, were
speedily being printed and studied, and were colouring
men&rsquo;s thoughts with the dreams of Plato and the
traditions of an age of republican freedom and dignity.  The
Roman dominion had first brought law and order to Western
Europe, and the Latin Church had restored it; but under both
Pagan and Catholic Rome curiosity and innovation were
subordinate to and restrained by organization.  The reign of
the Latin mind was now drawing to an end.  Between the
thirteenth and the sixteenth century the European Aryans,
thanks to the stimulating influence of Semite and Mongol and
the rediscovery of the Greek classics, broke away from the
Latin tradition and rose again to the intellectual and
material leadership of mankind.

<h4 align="center">THE REFORMATION OF THE LATIN CHURCH</h4>

<p>

THE Latin Church itself was enormously affected by this
mental rebirth.  It was dismembered; and even the portion
that survived was extensively renewed.
</p>

<p>
We have told how nearly the church came to the autocratic
leadership of all Christendom in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, and how in the fourteenth and fifteenth its power
over men&rsquo;s minds and affairs declined.  We have
described how popular religious enthusiasm which had in
earlier ages been its support and power was turned against it
by its pride, persecutions and centralization, and how the
insidious scepticism of Frederick II bore fruit in a growing
insubordination of the princes.  The Great Schism had reduced
its religious and political prestige to negligible
proportions.  The forces of insurrection struck it now from
both sides.
</p>

<p>
The teachings of the Englishman Wycliffe spread widely
throughout Europe.  In 1398 a learned Czech, John Huss,
delivered a series of lectures upon Wycliffe&rsquo;s
teachings in the university of Prague.  This teaching spread
rapidly beyond the educated class and aroused great popular
enthusiasm.  In 1414-18 a Council of the whole church was
held at Constance to settle the Great Schism.  Huss was
invited to this Council under promise of a safe conduct from
the emperor, seized, put on trial for heresy and burnt alive
(1415).  So far from tranquillizing the Bohemian people, this
led to an insurrection of the Hussites in that country, the
first of a series of religious wars that inaugurated the
break-up of Latin Christendom.  Against this insurrection
Pope Martin V, the Pope specially elected at Constance as the
head of a reunited Christendom, preached a Crusade.
</p>

<p>
Five Crusades in all were launched upon this sturdy little
people and all of them failed.  All the unemployed ruffianism
of Europe was <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P305"></a>305}</span>turned upon Bohemia in the
fifteenth century, just as in the thirteenth it had been
turned upon the Waldenses.  But the Bohemian Czechs, unlike
the Waldenses, believed in armed resistance.  The Bohemian
Crusade dissolved and streamed away from the battlefield at
the sound of the Hussites&rsquo; waggons and the distant
chanting of their troops; it did not even wait to fight
(battle of Domazlice, 1431).  In 1436 an agreement was
patched up with the Hussites by a new Council of the church
at Basle in which many of the special objections to Latin
practice were conceded.

<p>
In the fifteenth century a great pestilence had produced much
social disorganization throughout Europe.  There had been
extreme misery and discontent among the common people, and
peasant risings against the landlords and the wealthy in
England and France.  After the Hussite Wars these peasant
insurrections increased in gravity in Germany and took on a
religious character.  Printing came in as an influence upon
this development.  By the middle of the fifteenth century
there were printers at work with movable type <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P306"></a>306}</span>in Holland and
the Rhineland.  The art spread to Italy and England, where
Caxton was printing in Westminster in 1477.  The immediate
consequence was a great increase and distribution of Bibles,
and greatly increased facilities for widespread popular
controversies.  The European world became a world of readers,
to an extent that had never happened to any community in the
past.  And this sudden irrigation of the general mind with
clearer ideas and more accessible information occurred just
at a time when the church was confused and divided and not in
a position to defend itself effectively, and when many
princes were looking for means to weaken its hold upon the
vast wealth it claimed in their dominions.
</p>

<p>
In Germany the attack upon the church gathered round the
personality of an ex-monk, Martin Luther (1483-1546), who
appeared in Wittenberg in 1517 offering disputations against
various orthodox doctrines and practices.  At first he
disputed in Latin in the fashion of the Schoolmen.  Then he
took up the new weapon of the printed word and scattered his
views far and wide in German addressed to the ordinary
people.  An attempt was made to suppress him as Huss had been
suppressed, but the printing press had changed conditions and
he had too many open and secret friends among the German
princes for this fate to overtake him.
</p>

<p>
For now in this age of multiplying ideas and weakened faith
there were many rulers who saw their advantage in breaking
the religious ties between their people and Rome.  They
sought to make themselves in person the heads of a more
nationalized religion.  England, Scotland, Sweden, Norway,
Denmark, North Germany and Bohemia, one after another,
separated themselves from the Roman Communion.  They have
remained separated ever since.

<p>
The various princes concerned cared very little for the moral
and intellectual freedom of their subjects.  They used the
religious doubts and insurgence of their peoples to
strengthen them against Rome, but they tried to keep a grip
upon the popular movement as soon as that rupture was
achieved and a national church set up under the control of
the crown.  But there has always been a curious vitality in
the teaching of Jesus, a direct appeal to righteousness and a
man&rsquo;s self-respect over every loyalty and every
subordination, lay or ecclesiastical.  None of these princely
churches broke <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P307"></a>307}</span>off without also breaking off a
number of fragmentary sects that would admit the intervention
of neither prince nor Pope between a man and his God.  In
England and Scotland, for example, there was a number of
sects who now held firmly to the Bible as their one guide in
life and belief.  They refused the disciplines of a state
church.  In England these dissentients were the Non-
conformists, who played a very large part in the polities of
that country in the seventeenth <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P308"></a>308}</span>and eighteenth centuries.  In
England they carried their objection to a princely head to
the church so far as to decapitate King Charles I (1649), and
for eleven prosperous years England was a republic under Non-
conformist rule.
</p>

<p>
The breaking away of this large section of Northern Europe
from Latin Christendom is what is generally spoken of as the
Reformation.  But the shock and stress of these losses
produced changes perhaps as profound in the Roman Church
itself.  The church was reorganized and a new spirit came
into its life.  One of the dominant figures in this revival
was a young Spanish soldier, Inigo Lopez de Recalde, better
known to the world as St. Ignatius of Loyola.  After some
romantic beginnings he became a priest (1538) and was
permitted to found the Society of Jesus, a direct attempt to
bring the generous and chivalrous traditions of military
discipline into the service of religion.  This Society of
Jesus, the Jesuits, became one of the greatest teaching and
missionary societies the world has ever seen.  It carried
Christianity to India, China and America.  It arrested the
rapid disintegration of the Roman Church.  It raised the
standard of education throughout the whole Catholic world; it
raised the level of Catholic intelligence and quickened the
Catholic conscience everywhere; it stimulated Protestant
Europe to competitive educational efforts.  The vigorous and
aggressive Roman Catholic Church we know to-day is largely
the product of this Jesuit revival.

<h4 align="center">THE EMPEROR CHARLES V</h4>

<p>

THE Holy Roman Empire came to a sort of climax in the reign
of the Emperor Charles V.  He was one of the most
extraordinary monarchs that Europe has ever seen.  For a time
he had the air of being the greatest monarch since
Charlemagne.
</p>

<p>
His greatness was not of his own making.  It was largely the
creation of his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian I (1459-
1519).  Some families have fought, others have intrigued
their way to world power; the Habsburgs married their way.
  Maximilian began his career with Austria, Styria, part of
Alsace and other districts, the original Habsburg patrimony;
he married&#8212;the lady&rsquo;s name scarcely matters to
us&#8212;the Netherlands and Burgundy.  Most of Burgundy
slipped from him after his first wife&rsquo;s death, but the
Netherlands he held.  Then he tried unsuccessfully to marry
Brittany.  He became Emperor in succession to his father,
Frederick III, in 1493, and married the duchy of Milan.
  Finally he married his son to the weak-minded daughter of
Ferdinand and Isabella, the Ferdinand and Isabella of
Columbus, who not only reigned over a freshly united Spain
and over Sardinia and the kingdom of the two Sicilies, but
over all America west of Brazil.  So it was that this Charles
V, his grandson, inherited most of the American continent and
between a third and a half of what the Turks had left of
Europe.  He succeeded to the Netherlands in 1506.  When his
grandfather Ferdinand died in 1516, he became practically
king of the Spanish dominions, his mother being imbecile; and
his grandfather Maximilian dying in 1519, he was in 1520
elected Emperor at the still comparatively tender age of
twenty.
</p>

<p>
He was a fair young man with a not very intelligent face, a
thick upper lip and a long clumsy chin.  He found himself in
a world of young and vigorous personalities.  It was an age
of brilliant young <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P310"></a>310}</span>monarchs.  Francis I had succeeded
to the French throne in 1515 at the age of twenty-one, Henry
VIII had become King of England in 1509 at eighteen.  It was
the age of Baber in India (1526-1530) and Suleiman the
Magnificent in Turkey (1520), both exceptionally capable
monarchs, and the Pope Leo X (1513) was also a very
distinguished Pope.  The Pope and Francis I attempted to
prevent the election of Charles as Emperor because they
dreaded the concentration of so much power in the hands of
one man.  Both Francis I and Henry VIII offered themselves to
the imperial electors.  But there was now a long established
tradition of Habsburg Emperors (since 1273), and some
energetic bribery secured the election for Charles.
</p>

<p>
At first the young man was very much a magnificent puppet in
the hands of his ministers.  Then slowly he began to assert
himself and take control.  He began to realize something of
the threatening complexities of his exalted position.  It was
a position as unsound as it was splendid.
</p>

<p>
From the very outset of his reign he was faced by the
situation created by Luther&rsquo;s agitations in Germany.
  The Emperor had one reason for siding with the reformers in
the opposition of the Pope to his election.  But he had been
brought up in Spain, that most Catholic of countries, and he
decided against Luther.  So he came into conflict with the
Protestant princes and particularly the Elector of Saxony.
  He found himself in the presence of an opening rift that was
to split the outworn fabric of Christendom into two
contending camps.  His attempts to close that rift were
strenuous and honest and ineffective.  There was an extensive
peasant revolt in Germany which interwove with the general
political and religious disturbance.  And these internal
troubles were complicated by attacks upon the Empire from
east and west alike.  On the west of Charles was his spirited
rival, Francis I; to the east was the ever advancing Turk,
who was now in Hungary, in alliance with Francis and
clamouring for certain arrears of tribute from the Austrian
dominions.  Charles had the money and army of Spain at his
disposal, but it was extremely difficult to get any effective
support in money from Germany.  His social and political
troubles were complicated by financial distresses.  He was
forced to ruinous borrowing.

<p>
<span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P312"></a>312}</span>On the whole,
Charles, in alliance with Henry VIII, was successful against
Francis I and the Turk.  Their chief battlefield was North
Italy; the generalship was dull on both sides; their advances
and retreats depended mainly on the arrival of
reinforcements.  The German army invaded France, failed to
take Marseilles, fell back into Italy, lost Milan, and was
besieged in Pavia.  Francis I made a long and unsuccessful
siege of Pavia, was caught by fresh German forces, defeated,
wounded and taken prisoner.  But thereupon the Pope and Henry
VIII, still haunted by the fear of his attaining excessive
power, turned against Charles.  The German troops in Milan,
under the Constable of Bourbon, being unpaid, forced rather
than followed their commander into a raid upon Rome.  They
stormed the city and pillaged it (1527).  The Pope took
refuge in the Castle of St. Angelo while the looting and
slaughter went on.  He bought off the German troops at last
by the payment of four hundred thousand ducats.  Ten years of
such confused fighting impoverished all Europe.  At last the
Emperor found himself triumphant in Italy.  In 1530, he was
crowned by the Pope&#8212;he was the last German Emperor to
be so crowned&#8212;at Bologna.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Turks were making great headway in Hungary.
  They had defeated and killed the king of Hungary in 1526,
they held Buda-Pesth, and in 1529 Suleiman the Magnificent
very nearly took Vienna.  The Emperor was greatly concerned
by these advances, and did his utmost to drive back the
Turks, but he found the greatest difficulty in getting the
German princes to unite even with this formidable enemy upon
their very borders.  Francis I remained implacable for a
time, and there was a new French war; but in 1538 Charles won
his rival over to a more friendly attitude after ravaging the
south of France.  Francis and Charles then formed an alliance
against the Turk.  But the Protestant princes, the German
princes who were resolved to break away from Rome, had formed
a league, the Schmalkaldic League, against the Emperor, and
in the place of a great campaign to recover Hungary for
Christendom Charles had to turn his mind to the gathering
internal struggle in Germany.  Of that struggle he saw only
the opening war.  It was a struggle, a sanguinary irrational
bickering of princes, for ascendancy, now <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P313"></a>313}</span>flaming into
war and destruction, now sinking back to intrigues and
diplomacies; it was a snake&rsquo;s sack of princely policies
that was to go on writhing incurably right into the
nineteenth century and to waste and desolate Central Europe
again and again.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor never seems to have grasped the true forces at
work in these gathering troubles.  He was for his time and
station an exceptionally worthy man, and he seems to have
taken the religious dissensions that were tearing Europe into
warring fragments as genuine theological differences.  He
gathered diets and councils in futile attempts at
reconciliation.  Formul&#230; and confessions were tried
over.  The student of German history must struggle with the
details of the Religious Peace of Nuremberg, the settlement
at the Diet of Ratisbon, the Interim of Augsburg, and the
like.  Here we do but mention them as details in the worried
life of this culminating Emperor.  As a matter of fact,
hardly one of the multifarious princes and rulers in Europe
seems to have been acting in good faith.  The widespread
religious trouble of the world, the desire of the common
people for truth and social righteousness, the spreading
knowledge of the time, all those things were merely counters
in the imaginations of princely diplomacy.  Henry VIII of
England, who had begun his career with a book against heresy,
and who had been rewarded by the Pope with the title of
&ldquo;Defender of the Faith,&rdquo; being anxious to divorce
his first wife in favour of a young lady named Anne Boleyn,
and wishing also to loot the vast wealth of the church in
England, joined the company of Protestant princes in 1530.
  Sweden, Denmark and Norway had already gone over to the
Protestant side.
</p>

<p>
The German religious war began in 1546, a few months after
the death of Martin Luther.  We need not trouble about the
incidents of the campaign.  The Protestant Saxon army was
badly beaten at Lochau.  By something very like a breach of
faith Philip of Hesse, the Emperor&rsquo;s chief remaining
antagonist, was caught and imprisoned, and the Turks were
bought off by the promise of an annual tribute.  In 1547, to
the great relief of the Emperor, Francis I died.  So by 1547
Charles got to a kind of settlement, and made his last
efforts to effect peace where there was no peace.  In 1552
all Germany was at war again, only a precipitate flight from
Innsbruck <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P314"></a>314}</span>saved Charles from capture, and in
1552, with the treaty of Passau, came another unstable
equilibrium ....
</p>

<p>
Such is the brief outline of the politics of the Empire for
thirty-two years.  It is interesting to note how entirely the
European mind was concentrated upon the struggle for European
ascendancy.  Neither Turks, French, English nor Germans had
yet discovered any political interest in the great continent
of America, nor any significance in the new sea routes to
Asia.  Great things were happening in America; Cortez with a
mere handful of men had conquered the great Neolithic empire
of Mexico for Spain, Pizarro had crossed the Isthmus of
Panama (1530) and subjugated another wonder-land, Peru.  But
as yet these events meant no more to Europe than a useful and
stimulating influx of silver to the Spanish treasury.
</p>

<p>
It was after the treaty of Passau that Charles began to
display his distinctive originality of mind.  He was now
entirely bored and disillusioned by his imperial greatness.
  A sense of the intolerable futility of these European
rivalries came upon him.  He had never been of a very sound
constitution, he was naturally indolent and he was suffering
greatly from gout.  He abdicated.  He made over all his
sovereign rights in Germany to his brother Ferdinand, and
Spain and the Netherlands he resigned to his son Philip.
  Then in a sort of magnificent dudgeon he retired to a
monastery at Yuste, among the oak and chestnut forests in the
hills to the north of the Tagus valley.  There he died in
1558.
</p>

<p>
Much has been written in a sentimental vein of this
retirement, this renunciation of the world by this tired
majestic Titan, world-weary, seeking in an austere solitude
his peace with God.  But his retreat was neither solitary nor
austere; he had with him nearly a hundred and fifty
attendants: his establishment had all the splendour and
indulgences without the fatigues or a court, and Philip II
was a dutiful son to whom his father&rsquo;s advice was a
command.

<p>
And if Charles had lost his living interest in the
administration of European affairs, there were other motives
of a more immediate sort to stir him.  Says Prescott:
&ldquo;In the almost daily correspondence between Quixada, or
Gaztelu, and the Secretary of State at Valladolid, there is
scarcely a letter that does not turn more or less on the
Emperor&rsquo;s eating or his illness.  The one seems
naturally to follow, <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P315"></a>315}</span>like a running commentary, on the
other.  It is rare that such topics have formed the burden of
communications with the department of state.  It must have
been no easy matter for the secretary to preserve his gravity
in the perusal of despatches in which politics and gastronomy
were so strangely mixed together.  The courier from
Valladolid to Lisbon was ordered to make a detour, so as to
take Jarandilla in his route, and bring supplies to the royal
table.  On <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P316"></a>316}</span>Thursdays he was to bring fish to
serve for the jour maigre that was to follow.  The trout in
the neighbourhood Charles thought too small, so others of a
larger size were to be sent from Valladolid.  Fish of every
kind was to his taste, as, indeed, was anything that in its
nature or habits at all approached to fish.  Eels, frogs,
oysters, occupied an important place in the royal bill of
fare.  Potted fish, especially anchovies, found great favour
with him; and he regretted that he had not brought a better
supply of these from the Low Countries.  On an eel-pasty he
particularly doted.&rdquo; ... [<a
name="chapLIfn1text"></a><a href="#chapLIfn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
In 1554 Charles had obtained a bull from Pope Julius III
granting him a dispensation from fasting, and allowing him to
break his fast early in the morning even when he was to take
the sacrament.
</p>

<p>
Eating and doctoring! it was a return to elemental things.
  He had never acquired the habit of reading, but he would be
read aloud to at meals after the fashion of Charlemagne, and
would make what one narrator describes as a &ldquo;sweet and
heavenly commentary.&rdquo;  He also amused himself with
mechanical toys, by listening to music or sermons, and by
attending to the imperial business that still came drifting
in to him.  The death of the Empress, to whom he was greatly
attached, had turned his mind towards religion, which in his
case took a punctilious and ceremonial form; every Friday in
Lent he scourged himself with the rest of the monks with such
good will as to draw blood.  These exercises and the gout
released a bigotry in Charles that had hitherto been
restrained by considerations of policy.  The appearance of
Protestant teaching close at hand in Valladolid roused him to
fury.  &ldquo;Tell the grand inquisitor and his council from
me to be at their posts, and to lay the axe at the root of
the evil before it spreads further.&rdquo; . .. He expressed
a doubt whether it would not be well, in so black an affair,
to dispense with the ordinary course of justice, and to show
no mercy; &ldquo;lest the criminal, if pardoned, should have
the opportunity of repeating his crime.&rdquo;  He
recommended, as an example, his own mode or proceeding in the
Netherlands, &ldquo;where all who remained obstinate in their
errors were burned alive, and those who were admitted to
penitence were beheaded.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And almost symbolical of his place and role in history was
his <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P317"></a>317}</span>preoccupation with funerals.  He
seems to have had an intuition that something great was dead
in Europe and sorely needed burial, that there was a need to
write Finis, overdue.  He not only attended every actual
funeral that was celebrated at Yuste, but he had services
conducted for the absent dead, he held a funeral service in
memory of his wife on the anniversary of her death, and
finally he celebrated his own obsequies.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The chapel was hung with black, and the blaze of
hundreds of wax-lights was scarcely sufficient to dispel the
darkness.  The brethren in their conventual dress, and all
the Emperor&rsquo;s household clad in deep mourning, gathered
round a huge catafalque, shrouded also in black, which had
been raised in the centre of the chapel.  The service for the
burial of the dead was then performed; and, amidst the dismal
wail of the monks, the prayers ascended for the departed
spirit, that it might be received into the mansions of the
blessed.  The sorrowful attendants were melted to tears, as
the image of their master&rsquo;s death was presented to
their minds&#8212;or they were touched, it may be, with
compassion by this pitiable display of weakness.  Charles,
muffled in a dark mantle, and bearing a lighted candle in his
hand, mingled with his household, the spectator of his own
obsequies; and the doleful ceremony was concluded by his
placing the taper in the hands of the priest, in sign of his
surrendering up his soul to the Almighty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Within two months of this masquerade he was dead.  And the
brief greatness of the Holy Roman Empire died with him.  His
realm was already divided between his brother and his son.
  The Holy Roman Empire struggled on indeed to the days of
Napoleon I but as an invalid and dying thing.  To this day
its unburied tradition still poisons the political air.

<h4 align="center">THE AGE OF POLITICAL EXPERIMENTS; OF GRAND
MONARCHY AND PARLIAMENTS AND REPUBLICANISM IN EUROPE</h4>

<p>

THE Latin Church was broken, the Holy Roman Empire was in
extreme decay; the history of Europe from the opening of the
sixteenth century onward is a story of peoples feeling their
way darkly to some new method of government, better adapted
to the new conditions that were arising.  In the Ancient
World, over long periods of time, there had been changes of
dynasty and even changes of ruling race and language, but the
form of government through monarch and temple remained fairly
stable, and still more stable was the ordinary way of living.
  In this modern Europe since the sixteenth century the
dynastic changes are unimportant, and the interest of history
lies in the wide and increasing variety of experiments in
political and social organization.
</p>

<p>
The political history of the world from the sixteenth century
onward was, we have said, an effort, a largely unconscious
effort, of mankind to adapt its political and social methods
to certain new conditions that had now arisen.  The effort to
adapt was complicated by the fad that the conditions
themselves were changing with a steadily increasing rapidity.
  The adaptation, mainly unconscious and almost always
unwilling (for man in general hates voluntary change), has
lagged more and more behind the alterations in conditions.
  From the sixteenth century onward the history of mankind is a
story of political and social institutions becoming more and
more plainly misfits, less comfortable and more vexatious,
and of the slow reluctant realization of the need for a
conscious and deliberate reconstruction of the whole scheme
of human societies in the face of needs and possibilities new
to all the former experiences of life.
</p>

<p>
What are these changes in the conditions of human life that
have disorganized that balance of empire, priest, peasant and
trader, with <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P319"></a>319}</span>periodic refreshment by barbaric
conquest, that has held human affairs in the Old World in a
sort of working rhythm for more than a hundred centuries?
</p>

<p>
They are manifold and various, for human affairs are
multitudinously complex; but the main changes seem all to
turn upon one cause, namely the growth and extension of a
knowledge of the nature of things, beginning first of all in
small groups of intelligent people and spreading at first
slowly, and in the last five hundred years very rapidly, to
larger and larger proportions of the general population.
</p>

<p>
But there has also been a great change in human conditions
due to a change in the spirit of human life.  This change has
gone on side by side with the increase and extension of
knowledge, and is subtly connected with it.  There has been
an increasing disposition to treat a life based on the common
and more elementary desires and gratifications as
unsatisfactory, and to seek relationship with and service and
participation in a larger life.  This is the common
characteristic of all the great religions that have spread
throughout the world in the last twenty odd centuries,
Buddhism, Christianity and Islam alike.  They have had to do
with the spirit of man in a way that the older religions did
not have to do.  They are forces quite different in their
nature and effect from the old fetishistic blood-sacrifice
religions of priest and temple that they have in part
modified and in part replaced.  They have gradually evolved a
self-respect in the individual and a sense of participation
and responsibility in the common concerns of mankind that did
not exist among the populations of the earlier civilizations.
</p>

<p>
The first considerable change in the conditions of political
and social life was the simplification and extended use of
writing in the ancient civilizations which made larger
empires and wider political understandings practicable and
inevitable.  The next movement forward came with the
introduction of the horse, and later on of the camel as a
means of transport, the use of wheeled vehicles, the
extension of roads and the increased military efficiency due
to the discovery of terrestrial iron.  Then followed the
profound economic disturbances due to the device of coined
money and the change in the nature of debt, proprietorship
and trade due to this convenient but dangerous convention.
  The empires grew in size and range, and <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P320"></a>320}</span>men&rsquo;s
ideas grew likewise to correspond with these things.  Came
the disappearance of local gods, the age of theocrasia, and
the teaching of the great world religions.  Came also the
beginnings of reasoned and recorded history and geography,
the first realization by man of his profound ignorance, and
the first systematic search for knowledge.
</p>

<p>
For a time the scientific process which began so brilliantly
in Greece and Alexandria was interrupted.  The raids of the
Teutonic barbarians, the westward drive of the Mongolian
peoples, convulsive religious reconstruction and great
pestilences put enormous strains upon political and social
order.  When civilization emerged again from this phase of
conflict and confusion, slavery was no longer the basis of
economic life; and the first paper-mills were preparing a new
medium for collective information and co-operation in printed
matter.  Gradually at this point and that, the search for
knowledge, the systematic scientific process, was resumed.
</p>

<p>
And now from the sixteenth century onward, as an inevitable
by-product of systematic thought, appeared a steadily
increasing series of inventions and devices affecting the
intercommunication and interaction of men with one another.
  They all tended towards wider range of action, greater mutual
benefits or injuries, and increased co-operation, and they
came faster and faster.  Men&rsquo;s minds had not been
prepared for anything of the sort, and until the great
catastrophes at the beginning of the twentieth century
quickened men&rsquo;s minds, the historian has very little to
tell of any intelligently planned attempts to meet the new
conditions this increasing flow of inventions was creating.
  The history of mankind for the last four centuries is rather
like that of an imprisoned sleeper, stirring clumsily and
uneasily while the prison that restrains and shelters him
catches fire, not waking but incorporating the crackling and
warmth of the fire with ancient and incongruous dreams, than
like that of a man consciously awake to danger and
opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Since history is the story not of individual lives but of
communities, it is inevitable that the inventions that figure
most in the historical record are inventions affecting
communications.  In the sixteenth century the chief new
things that we have to note are the appearance of printed
paper and the sea-worthy, ocean-going sailing ship using the
new device of the mariner&rsquo;s compass.  The former <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P321"></a>321}</span>cheapened,
spread, and revolutionized teaching, public information and
discussion, and the fundamental operations of political
activity.  The latter made the round world one.  But almost
equally important was the increased utilization and
improvement of guns and gunpowder which the Mongols had first
brought westward in the thirteenth century.  This destroyed
the practical immunity of barons in their castles and of
walled cities.  Guns swept away feudalism.  Constantinople
fell to guns. Mexico and Peru fell before the terror of the
Spanish guns.

<p>
The seventeenth century saw the development of systematic
scientific publication, a less conspicuous but ultimately far
more pregnant innovation.  Conspicuous among the leaders in
this great forward step was Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626)
afterwards Lord <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P322"></a>322}</span>Verulam, Lord Chancellor of
England.  He was the pupil and perhaps the mouthpiece of
another Englishman; Dr. Gilbert, the experimental philosopher
of Colchester (1540-1603).  This second Bacon, like the
first, preached observation and experiment, and he used the
inspiring and fruitful form of a Utopian story, <i>The New
Atlantis</i>, to express his dream of a great service of
scientific research.
</p>

<p>
Presently arose the Royal Society of London, the Florentine
Society, and later other national bodies for the
encouragement of research and the publication and exchange of
knowledge.  These European scientific societies became
fountains not only of countless inventions but also of a
destructive criticism of the grotesque theological history of
the world that had dominated and crippled human thought for
many centuries.
</p>

<p>
Neither the seventeenth nor the eighteenth century witnessed
any innovations so immediately revolutionary in human
conditions as printed paper and the ocean-going ship, but
there was a steady accumulation of knowledge and scientific
energy that was to bear its full fruits in the nineteenth
century.  The exploration and mapping of the world went on.
  Tasmania, Australia, New Zealand appeared on the map.  In
Great Britain in the eighteenth century coal coke began to be
used for metallurgical purposes, leading to a considerable
cheapening of iron and to the possibility of casting and
using it in larger pieces than had been possible before, when
it had been smelted with wood charcoal.  Modern machinery
dawned.
</p>

<p>
Like the trees of the celestial city, science bears bud and
flower and fruit at the same time and continuously.  With the
onset of the nineteenth century the real fruition of
science&#8212;which indeed henceforth may never
cease&#8212;began.  First came steam and steel, the railway,
the great liner, vast bridges and buildings, machinery of
almost limitless power, the possibility of a bountiful
satisfaction of every material human need, and then, still
more wonderful, the hidden treasures of electrical science
were opened to men ....
</p>

<p>
We have compared the political and social life of man from
the sixteenth century onward to that of a sleeping prisoner
who lies and dreams while his prison burns about him.  In the
sixteenth century the European mind was still going on with
its Latin Imperial dream, <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P323"></a>323}</span>its dream of a Holy Roman Empire,
united under a Catholic Church.  But just as some
uncontrollable element in our composition will insist at
times upon introducing into our dreams the most absurd and
destructive comments, so thrust into this dream we find the
sleeping face and craving stomach of the Emperor Charles V,
while Henry VIII of England and Luther tear the unity of
Catholicism to shreds.

</center>

<p>
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the dream turned
to personal monarchy.  The history of nearly all Europe
during this period tells with variations the story of an
attempt to consolidate a monarchy, to make it absolute and to
extend its power over weaker adjacent regions, and of the
steady resistance, first of the landowners and then with the
increase of foreign trade and home industry, of the growing
trading and moneyed class, to the exaction and interference
of the crown.  There is no universal victory of either side;
here it is the King who gets the upper hand while there it is
the <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P324"></a>324}</span>man
of private property who beats the King.  In one case we find
a King becoming the sun and centre of his national world,
while just over his borders a sturdy mercantile class
maintains a republic.  So wide a range of variation shows how
entirely experimental, what local accidents, were all the
various governments of this period.
</p>

<p>
A very common figure in these national dramas is the
King&rsquo;s minister, often in the still Catholic countries
a prelate, who stands behind the King, serves him and
dominates him by his indispensable services.
</p>

<p>
Here in the limits set to us it is impossible to tell these
various national dramas in detail.  The trading folk of
Holland went Protestant and republican, and cast off the rule
of Philip II of Spain, the son of the Emperor Charles V.  In
England Henry VIII and his minister Wolsey, Queen Elizabeth
and her minister Burleigh, prepared the foundations of an
absolutism that was wrecked by the folly of James I and
Charles I.  Charles I was beheaded for treason to his people
(1649), a new turn in the political thought of Europe.  For a
dozen years (until 1660) Britain was a republic; and the
crown was an unstable power, much overshadowed by Parliament,
until George III (1760-1820) made a strenuous and partly
successful effort to restore its predominance.  The King of
France, on the other hand, was the most successful of all the
European Kings in perfecting monarchy.  Two great ministers,
Richelieu (1585-1642) and Mazarin (1602-1661), built up the
power of the crown in that country, and the process was aided
by the long reign and very considerable abilities of King
Louis XIV, &ldquo;the Grand Monarque&rdquo; (1643-1715).
</p>

<p>
Louis XIV was indeed the pattern King of Europe.  He was,
within his limitations, an exceptionally capable King; his
ambition was stronger than his baser passions, and he guided
his country towards bankruptcy through the complication of a
spirited foreign policy with an elaborate dignity that still
extorts our admiration.  His immediate desire was to
consolidate and extend France to the Rhine and Pyrenees, and
to absorb the Spanish Netherlands; his remoter view saw the
French Kings as the possible successors of Charlemagne in a
recast Holy Roman Empire.  He made bribery a state method
almost more important than warfare.  Charles II of <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P325"></a>325}</span>England was in
his pay, and so were most of the Polish nobility, presently
to be described.  His money, or rather the money of the tax-
paying classes in France, went everywhere.  But his
prevailing occupation was splendour.  His great palace at
Versailles with its salons, its corridors, its mirrors, its
terraces and fountains and parks and prospects, was the envy
and admiration of the world.

<p>
He provoked a universal imitation.  Every king and princelet
in Europe was building his own Versailles as much beyond his
means as his subjects and credits would permit.  Everywhere
the nobility rebuilt or extended their chateaux to the new
pattern.  A great industry of beautiful and elaborate fabrics
and furnishings developed.  The luxurious arts flourished
everywhere; sculpture in alabaster, faience, gilt woodwork,
metal work, stamped leather, much music, magnificent
painting, beautiful printing and bindings, fine crockery,
fine vintages.  Amidst the mirrors and fine furniture went a
strange race of &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; in tall powdered
wigs, silks and laces, poised upon high red heels, supported
by amazing canes; and still more wonderful
&ldquo;ladies,&rdquo; under towers of powdered hair and
wearing vast expansions of silk and satin sustained on wire.
  Through it all postured the great Louis, the sun of his
world, unaware of the meagre and sulky and bitter faces that
watched him from those lower darknesses to which his sunshine
did not penetrate.

<p>
The German people remained politically divided throughout
this period of the monarchies and experimental governments,
and a considerable <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P326"></a>326}</span>number of ducal and princely
courts aped the splendours of Versailles on varying scales.
  The Thirty Years&rsquo; War (1618-48), a devastating scramble
among the Germans, Swedes and Bohemians for fluctuating
political advantages, sapped the energies of Germany for a
century.  A map must show the crazy patchwork in which this
struggle ended, a map of Europe according to the peace of
Westphalia (1648).  One sees a tangle of principalities,
dukedoms, free states and the like, some partly in and partly
out of the Empire.  Sweden&rsquo;s arm, the reader will note,
reached far into Germany; and except for a few islands of
territory within the imperial boundaries France was still far
from the Rhine.  Amidst this patchwork the <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P327"></a>327}</span>Kingdom of
Prussia&#8212;it became a Kingdom in 1701&#8212;rose steadily
to prominence and sustained a series of successful wars.
  Frederick the Great of Prussia (1740-86) had his Versailles
at Potsdam, where his court spoke French, read French
literature and rivalled the culture of the French King.
</p>

<p>
In 1714 the Elector of Hanover became King of England, adding
one more to the list of monarchies half in and half out of
the empire.
</p>

<p>
The Austrian branch of the descendants of Charles V retained
the title of Emperor; the Spanish branch retained Spain.  But
now there was also an Emperor of the East again.  After the
fall of Constantinople (1453), the grand duke of Moscow, Ivan
the Great (1462-1505), claimed to be heir to the Byzantine
throne and adopted the Byzantine double-headed eagle upon his
arms.  His grandson, Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible (1533-1584),
assumed the imperial title of C&#230;sar (Tsar).  But only in
the latter half of the seventeenth century did Russia cease
to seem remote and Asiatic to the European mind.  The Tsar
Peter the Great (1682-1725) brought Russia into the arena of
Western affairs.  He built a new capital for his empire,
Petersburg upon the Neva, that played the part of a window
between Russia and Europe, and he set up his Versailles at
Peterhof eighteen miles away, employing a French architect
who gave him a terrace, fountains, cascades, picture gallery,
park and all the recognized appointments of Grand Monarchy.
  In Russia as in Prussia French became the language of the
court.
</p>

<p>
Unhappily placed between Austria, Prussia and Russia was the
Polish kingdom, an ill-organized state of great landed
proprietors too jealous of their own individual grandeur to
permit more than a nominal kingship to the monarch they
elected.  Her fate was division among these three neighbours,
in spite of the efforts of France to retain her as an
independent ally.  Switzerland at this time was a group of
republican cantons; Venice was a republic; Italy like so much
of Germany was divided among minor dukes and princes.  The
Pope ruled like a prince in the papal states, too fearful now
of losing the allegiance of the remaining Catholic princes to
interfere between them and their subjects or to remind the
world of the commonweal of Christendom. There remained indeed
no common <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P328"></a>328}</span>political idea in Europe at all;
Europe was given over altogether to division and diversity.
</p>

<p>
All these sovereign princes and republics carried on schemes
of aggrandizement against each other.  Each one of them
pursued a &ldquo;foreign policy&rdquo; of aggression against
its neighbours and of aggressive alliances.  We Europeans
still live to-day in the last phase of this age of the
multifarious sovereign states, and still suffer from the
hatreds, hostilities and suspicions it engendered.  The
history of this time becomes more and more manifestly
&ldquo;gossip,&rdquo; more and more unmeaning and wearisome
to a modern intelligence.  You are told of how this war was
caused by this King&rsquo;s mistress, and how the jealousy of
one minister for another caused that.  A tittle-tattle of
bribes and rivalries disgusts the intelligent student.  The
more permanently significant fact is that in spite of the
obstruction of a score of frontiers, reading and thought
still spread and increased and inventions multiplied.  The
eighteenth century saw the appearance of a literature
profoundly sceptical and critical of the courts and policies
of the time.  In such a book as Voltaire&rsquo;s
<i>Candide</i> we have the expression of an infinite
weariness with the planless confusion of the European world.

<h4 align="center">THE NEW EMPIRES OF THE EUROPEANS IN ASIA
AND OVERSEAS</h4>

<p>

WHILE Central Europe thus remained divided and confused, the
Western Europeans and particularly the Dutch, the
Scandinavians, the Spanish, the Portuguese, the French and
the British were extending the area of their struggles across
the seas of all the world.  The printing press had dissolved
the political ideas of Europe into a vast and at first
indeterminate fermentation, but that other great innovation,
the ocean-going sailing ship, was inexorably extending the
range of European experience to the furthermost limits of
salt water.
</p>

<p>
The first overseas settlements of the Dutch and Northern
Atlantic Europeans were not for colonization but for trade
and mining.  The Spaniards were first in the field; they
claimed dominion over the whole of this new world of America.
  Very soon however the Portuguese asked for a share.  The
Pope&#8212;it was one of the last acts of Rome as mistress of
the world&#8212;divided the new continent between these two
first-comers, giving Portugal Brazil and everything else east
of a line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, and all
the rest to Spain (1494).  The Portuguese at this time were
also pushing overseas enterprise southward and eastward.  In
1497 Vasco da Gama had sailed from Lisbon round the Cape to
Zanzibar and then to Calicut in India.  In 1515 there were
Portuguese ships in Java and the Moluccas, and the Portuguese
were setting up and fortifying trading stations round and
about the coasts of the Indian Ocean.  Mozambique, Goa, and
two smaller possessions in India, Macao in China and a part
of Timor are to this day Portuguese possessions.
</p>

<p>
The nations excluded from America by the papal settlement
paid little heed to the rights of Spain and Portugal.  The
English, the Danes and Swedes, and presently the Dutch, were
soon staking <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P330"></a>330}</span>out claims in North America and
the West Indies, and his Most Catholic Majesty of France
heeded the papal settlement as little as any Protestant.  The
wars of Europe extended themselves to these claims and
possessions.

<p>
In the long run the English were the most successful in this
scramble for overseas possessions. The Danes and Swedes were
too <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P331"></a>331}</span>deeply entangled in the
complicated affairs of Germany to sustain effective
expeditions abroad.  Sweden was wasted upon the German
battlefields by a picturesque king, Gustavus Adolphus, the
Protestant &ldquo;Lion of the North.&rdquo;  The Dutch were
the heirs of such small settlements as Sweden made in
America, and the Dutch were too near French aggressions to
hold their own against the British.  In the far East the
chief rivals for empire were the British, Dutch and French,
and in America the British, French and Spanish.  The British
had the supreme advantage of a water frontier, the
&ldquo;silver streak&rdquo; of the English Channel, against
Europe.  The tradition of the Latin Empire entangled them
least.

France has always thought too much in terms of Europe.
  Throughout the eighteenth century she was wasting her
opportunities of expansion in West and East alike in order to
dominate Spain, Italy and the German confusion.  The
religious and political dissensions of Britain in the
seventeenth century had driven many <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P332"></a>332}</span>of the English to seek a permanent
home in America.  They struck root and increased and
multiplied, giving the British a great advantage in the
American struggle.  In 1756 and 1760 the French lost Canada
to the British and their American colonists, and a few years
later the British trading company found itself completely
dominant over French, Dutch and Portuguese in the peninsula
of India.  The great Mongol Empire of Baber, Akbar and their
successors had now far gone in decay, and the story of its
practical capture by a London trading company, the British
East India Company, is one of the most extraordinary episodes
in the whole history of conquest.

<p>
This East India Company had been originally at the time of
its incorporation under Queen Elizabeth no more than a
company of sea adventurers.  Step by step they had been
forced to raise troops and arm their ships.  And now this
trading company, with its tradition of gain, found itself
dealing not merely in spices and dyes and tea and jewels, but
in the revenues and territories of princes <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P333"></a>333}</span>and the
destinies of India.  It had come to buy and sell, and it
found itself achieving a tremendous piracy.  There was no one
to challenge its proceedings.  Is it any wonder that its
captains and commanders and officials, nay, even its clerks
and common soldiers, came back to England loaded with spoils?
</p>

<p>
Men under such circumstances, with a great and wealthy land
at their mercy, could not determine what they might or might
not do.  It was a strange land to them, with a strange
sunlight; its brown people seemed a different race, outside
their range of sympathy; its mysterious temples sustained
fantastic standards of behaviour.  Englishmen at home were
perplexed when presently these generals and officials came
back to make dark accusations against each other of
extortions and cruelties.  Upon Clive Parliament passed a
vote of censure.  He committed suicide in 1774.  In 1788
Warren Hastings, a second great Indian administrator, was
impeached and acquitted (1792).  It was a strange and
unprecedented situation in the world&rsquo;s history.  The
English Parliament found itself ruling over a London trading
company, which in its turn was dominating an empire far
greater and more populous than all the domains of the British
crown.  To the bulk of the English people India was a remote,
fantastic, almost inaccessible land, to which adventurous
poor young men went out, to return after many years very rich
and very choleric old gentlemen.  It was difficult for the
English to conceive what the life of these countless brown
millions in the eastern sunshine could be.  Their
imaginations declined the task.  India remained romantically
unreal.  It was impossible for the English, therefore, to
exert any effective supervision and control over the
company&rsquo;s proceedings.
</p>

<p>
And while the Western European powers were thus fighting for
these fantastic overseas empires upon every ocean in the
world, two great land conquests were in progress in Asia.
  China had thrown off the Mongol yoke in 1360, and flourished
under the great native dynasty of the Mings until 1644.  Then
the Manchus, another Mongol people, reconquered China and
remained masters of China until 1912.  Meanwhile Russia was
pushing East and growing to greatness in the world&rsquo;s
affairs.  The rise of this great central power of the old
world, which is neither altogether of the East nor <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P334"></a>334}</span>altogether of
the West, is one of the utmost importance to our human
destiny.  Its expansion is very largely due to the appearance
of a Christian steppe people, the Cossacks, who formed a
barrier between the feudal agriculture of Poland and Hungary
to the west and the Tartar to the east.  The Cossacks were
the wild east of Europe, and in many ways not unlike the wild
west of the United States in the middle nineteenth century.
  All who had made Russia too hot to hold them, criminals as
well as the persecuted innocent, rebellious serfs, religious
secretaries, thieves, vagabonds, murderers, sought asylum in
the southern steppes and there made a fresh start and fought
for life and freedom against Pole, Russian and Tartar alike.
  Doubtless fugitives from the Tartars to the east also
contributed to the Cossack mixture.  Slowly these border folk
were incorporated in the Russian imperial service, much as
the highland clans of Scotland were converted into regiments
by the British government.  New lands were offered them in
Asia.  They became a weapon against the dwindling power of
the Mongolian nomads, first in Turkestan and then across
Siberia as far as the Amur.
</p>

<p>
The decay of Mongol energy in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries is very difficult to explain.  Within two or three
centuries from the days of Jengis and Timurlane Central Asia
had relapsed from a period of world ascendancy to extreme
political impotence.  Changes of climate, unrecorded
pestilences, infections of a malarial type, may have played
their part in this recession&#8212;which may be only a
temporary recession measured by the scale of universal
history&#8212;of the Central Asian peoples.  Some authorities
think that the spread of Buddhist teaching from China also
had a pacifying influence upon them.  At any rate, by the
sixteenth century the Mongol, Tartar and Turkish peoples were
no longer pressing outward, but were being invaded,
subjugated and pushed back both by Christian Russia in the
west and by China in the east.
</p>

<p>
All through the seventeenth century the Cossacks were
spreading eastward from European Russia, and settling
wherever they found agricultural conditions.  Cordons of
forts and stations formed a moving frontier to these
settlements to the south, where the Turkomans were still
strong and active; to the north-east, however, Russia had no
frontier until she reached right to the Pacific ....

<h4 align="center">THE AMERICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE</h4>

<p>

THE third quarter of the eighteenth century thus saw the
remarkable and unstable spectacle of a Europe divided against
itself, and no longer with any unifying political or
religious idea, yet through the immense stimulation of
men&rsquo;s imaginations by the printed book, the printed
map, and the opportunity of the new ocean-going shipping,
able in a disorganized and contentious manner to dominate all
the coasts of the world.  It was a planless, incoherent
ebullition of enterprise due to temporary and almost
accidental advantages over the rest of mankind.  By virtue of
these advantages this new and still largely empty continent
of America was peopled mainly from Western European sources,
and South Africa and Australia and New Zealand marked down as
prospective homes for a European population.
</p>

<p>
The motive that had sent Columbus to America and Vasco da
Gama to India was the perennial first motive of all sailors
since the beginning of things&#8212;trade.  But while in the
already populous and productive East the trade motive
remained dominant, and the European settlements remained
trading settlements from which the European inhabitants hoped
to return home to spend their money, the Europeans in
America, dealing with communities at a very much lower level
of productive activity, found a new inducement for
persistence in the search for gold and silver.  Particularly
did the mines of Spanish America yield silver.  The Europeans
had to go to America not simply as armed merchants but as
prospectors, miners, searchers after natural products, and
presently as planters.  In the north they sought furs.  Mines
and plantations necessitated settlements.  They obliged
people to set up permanent overseas homes.  Finally in some
cases, as when the English Puritans went to New England in
the early seventeenth <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P336">
</a>336}</span>century to escape religious
persecution, when in the eighteenth Oglethorpe sent people
from the English debtors&rsquo; prisons to Georgia, and when
in the end of the eighteenth the Dutch sent orphans to the
Cape of Good Hope, the Europeans frankly crossed the seas to
find new homes for good.  In the nineteenth century, and
especially after the coming of the steamship, the stream of
European emigration to the new empty lands of America and
Australia rose for some decades to the scale of a great
migration.
</p>

<p>
So there grew up permanent overseas populations of Europeans,
and the European culture was transplanted to much larger
areas than those in which it had been developed.  These new
communities bringing a ready-made civilization with them to
these new lands grew up, as it were, unplanned and
unperceived; the statecraft of Europe did not foresee them,
and was unprepared with any ideas about their treatment.  The
politicians and ministers of Europe continued to regard them
as essentially expeditionary establishments, sources of
revenue, &ldquo;possessions&rdquo; and
&ldquo;dependencies,&rdquo; long after their peoples had
developed a keen sense of their separate social life.  And
also they continued to treat them as helplessly subject to
the mother country long after the population had spread
inland out of reach of any effectual punitive operations from
the sea.
</p>

<p>
Because until right into the nineteenth century, it must be
remembered, the link of all these overseas empires was the
oceangoing sailing ship.  On land the swiftest thing was
still the horse, and the cohesion and unity of political
systems on land was still limited by the limitations of horse
communications.
</p>

<p>
Now at the end of the third quarter of the eighteenth century
the northern two-thirds of North America was under the
British crown.  France had abandoned America.  Except for
Brazil, which was Portuguese, and one or two small islands
and areas in French, British, Danish and Dutch hands,
Florida, Louisiana, California and all America to the south
was Spanish.  It was the British colonies south of Maine and
Lake Ontario that first demonstrated the inadequacy of the
sailing ship to hold overseas populations together in one
political system.
</p>

<p>
These British colonies were very miscellaneous in their
origin and character.  There were French, Swedish and Dutch
settlements <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P337"></a>337}</span>as well as British; there were
British Catholics in Maryland and British ultra-Protestants
in New England, and while the New Englanders farmed their own
land and denounced slavery, the British in Virginia and the
south were planters employing a swelling multitude of
imported negro slaves.  There was no natural common unity in
such states.  To get from one to the other might mean a
coasting voyage hardly less tedious than the transatlantic
crossing.  But the union that diverse origin and natural
conditions denied the British Americans was forced upon them
by the selfishness and stupidity of the British government in
London.  They were taxed without any voice in the spending of
the taxes; their trade was sacrificed to British interests;
the highly profitable slave trade was maintained by the
British government in spite of the opposition of the
Virginians who&#8212;though quite willing to hold and use
slaves&#8212;feared to be swamped by an ever-growing barbaric
black population.

<p>
Britain at that time was lapsing towards an intenser form of
monarchy, and the obstinate personality of George III (1760-
1820) did much to force on a struggle between the home and
the colonial governments.
</p>

<p>
The conflict was precipitated by legislation which favoured
the London East India Company at the expense of the American
shipper.  Three cargoes of tea which were imported under the
new conditions were thrown overboard in Boston harbour by a
band of men disguised as Indians (1773).  <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P338"></a>338}</span>Fighting only
began in 1775 when the British government attempted to arrest
two of the American leaders at Lexington near Boston.  The
first shots were fired in Lexington by the British; the first
fighting occurred at Concord.

<p>
So the American War of Independence began, though for more
than a year the colonists showed themselves extremely
unwilling to sever their links with the mother land.  It was
not until the middle of 1776 that the Congress of the
insurgent states issued &ldquo;The Declaration of
Independence.&rdquo;  George Washington, who like many of the
leading colonists of the time had had a military training in
the wars against the French, was made commander-in-chief.  In
1777 a British general, General Burgoyne, in an attempt to
reach New York from Canada, was defeated at Freemans Farm and
obliged to surrender at Saratoga.  In the same year the
French and Spanish declared war upon Great Britain, greatly
hampering her sea communications.  A second British army
under General Cornwallis was caught in the Yorktown peninsula
in Virginia and obliged to capitulate in 1781.  In 1783 peace
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P339"></a>339}</span>was made
in Paris, and the Thirteen Colonies from Maine to Georgia
became a union of independent sovereign States.  So the
United States of America came into existence.  Canada
remained loyal to the British flag.

</center>

<p>
For four years these States had only a very feeble central
government under certain Articles of Confederation, and they
seemed destined to break up into separate independent
communities.  Their immediate separation was delayed by the
hostility of the British and a certain aggressiveness on the
part of the French which brought <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P340"></a>340}</span>home to them the immediate dangers
of division.  A Constitution was drawn up and ratified in
1788 establishing a more efficient Federal government with a
President holding very considerable powers, and the weak
sense of national unity was invigorated by a second war with
Britain in 1812.  Nevertheless the area covered by the States
was so wide and their interests so diverse at that time,
that&#8212;given only the means of communication then
available&#8212;a disintegration of the Union into separate
states on the European scale of size was merely a question of
time.  Attendance at Washington meant a long, tedious and
insecure journey for the senators and congressmen of the
remoter districts, and the mechanical impediments to the
diffusion of a common education and a common literature and
intelligence were practically insurmountable.  Forces were at
work in the world however that were to arrest the process of
differentiation altogether.  Presently came the river
steamboat and then the railway and the telegraph to save the
United States from fragmentation, and weave its dispersed
people together again into the first of great modern nations.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-two years later the Spanish colonies in America were
to follow the example of the Thirteen and break their
connection with Europe.  But being more dispersed over the
continent and separated by great mountainous chains and
deserts and forests and by the Portuguese Empire of Brazil,
they did not achieve a union among themselves.  They became a
constellation of republican states, very prone at first to
wars among themselves and to revolutions.
</p>

<p>
Brazil followed a rather different line towards the
inevitable separation.  In 1807 the French armies under
Napoleon had occupied the mother country of Portugal, and the
monarchy had fled to Brazil.  From that time on until they
separated, Portugal was rather a dependency of Brazil than
Brazil of Portugal.  In 1822 Brazil declared itself a
separate Empire under Pedro I, a son of the Portuguese King.
  But the new world has never been very favourable to monarchy.
  In 1889 the Emperor of Brazil was shipped off quietly to
Europe, and the United States of Brazil fell into line with
the rest of republican America.

<h4 align="center">THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE RESTORATION
OF MONARCHY IN FRANCE</h4>

<p>

BRITAIN had hardly lost the Thirteen Colonies in America
before a profound social and political convulsion at the very
heart of Grand Monarchy was to remind Europe still more
vividly of the essentially temporary nature of the political
arrangements of the world.
</p>

<p>
We have said that the French monarchy was the most successful
of the personal monarchies in Europe.  It was the envy and
model of a multitude of competing and minor courts.  But it
flourished on a basis of injustice that led to its dramatic
collapse.  It was brilliant and aggressive, but it was
wasteful of the life and substance of its common people.  The
clergy and nobility were protected from taxation by a system
of exemption that threw the whole burden of the state upon
the middle and lower classes.  The peasants were ground down
by taxation; the middle classes were dominated and humiliated
by the nobility.
</p>

<p>
In 1787 this French monarchy found itself bankrupt and
obliged to call representatives of the different classes of
the realm into consultation upon the perplexities of
defective income and excessive expenditure.  In 1789 the
States General, a gathering of the nobles, clergy and
commons, roughly equivalent to the earlier form of the
British Parliament, was called together at Versailles.  It
had not assembled since 1610.  For all that time France had
been an absolute monarchy.  Now the people found a means of
expressing their long fermenting discontent.  Disputes
immediately broke out between the three estates, due to the
resolve of the Third Estate, the Commons, to control the
Assembly.  The Commons got the better of these disputes and
the States General became a National Assembly, clearly
resolved to keep the crown in order, as the British
Parliament kept the British <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P342"></a>342}</span>crown in order.  The king (Louis
XVI) prepared for a struggle and brought up troops from the
provinces.  Whereupon Paris and France revolted.
</p>

<p>
The collapse of the absolute monarchy was very swift.  The
grim-looking prison of the Bastille was stormed by the people
of Paris, and the insurrection spread rapidly throughout
France.  In the east and north-west provinces many chateaux
belonging to the nobility were burnt by the peasants, their
title-deeds carefully destroyed, and the owners murdered or
driven away.  In a month the ancient and decayed system of
the aristocratic order had collapsed.  Many of the leading
princes and courtiers of the queen&rsquo;s party fled abroad.
  A provisional city government was set up in Paris and in most
of the other large cities, and a new armed force, the
National Guard, a force designed primarily and plainly to
resist the forces of the crown, was brought into existence by
these municipal bodies.  The National Assembly found itself
called upon to create a new political and social system for a
new age.
</p>

<p>
It was a task that tried the powers of that gathering to the
utmost.  It made a great sweep of the chief injustices of the
absolutist regime; it abolished tax exemptions, serfdom,
aristocratic titles and privileges and sought to establish a
constitutional monarchy in Paris.  The king abandoned
Versailles and its splendours and kept a diminished state in
the palace of the Tuileries in Paris.
</p>

<p>
For two years it seemed that the National Assembly might
struggle through to an effective modernized government.  Much
of its work was sound and still endures, if much was
experimental and had to be undone.  Much was ineffective.
  There was a clearing up of the penal code; torture, arbitrary
imprisonment and persecutions for heresy were abolished.  The
ancient provinces of France, Normandy, Burgundy and the like
gave place to eighty departments.  Promotion to the highest
ranks in the army was laid open to men of every class.  An
excellent and simple system of law courts was set up, but its
value was much vitiated by having the judges appointed by
popular election for short periods of time.  This made the
crowd a sort of final court of appeal, and the judges, like
the members of the Assembly, were forced to play to the
gallery.  And the whole vast property of the church was
seized and administered <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P343"></a>343}</span>by the state; religious
establishments not engaged in education or works of charity
were broken up, and the salaries of the clergy made a charge
upon the nation.  This in itself was not a bad thing for the
lower clergy in France, who were often scandalously underpaid
in comparison with the richer dignitaries.  But in addition
the choice of priests and bishops was made elective, which
struck at the very root idea of the Roman Church, which
centred everything upon the Pope, and in which all authority
is from above downward.  Practically the National Assembly
wanted at one blow to make the church in France Protestant,
in organization if not in doctrine.  Everywhere there were
disputes and conflicts between the state priests created by
the National Assembly and the recalcitrant (non-juring)
priests who were loyal to Rome.
</p>

<p>
In 1791 the experiment of Constitutional monarchy in France
was brought to an abrupt end by the action of the king and
queen, working in concert with their aristocratic and
monarchist friends abroad.  Foreign armies gathered on the
Eastern frontier and one night in June the king and queen and
their children slipped away from the Tuileries and fled to
join the foreigners and the aristocratic exiles.  They were
caught at Varennes and brought back to Paris, and an France
flamed up into a passion of patriotic republicanism.  A
Republic was proclaimed, open war with Austria and Prussia
ensued, and the king was tried and executed (January, 1793)
on the model already set by England, for treason to his
people.
</p>

<p>
And now followed a strange phase in the history of the French
people.  There arose a great flame of enthusiasm for France
and the Republic.  There was to be an end to compromise at
home and abroad; at home royalists and every form of
disloyalty were to be stamped out; abroad France was to be
the protector and helper of all revolutionaries.  All Europe,
all the world, was to become Republican.  The youth of France
poured into the Republican armies; a new and wonderful song
spread through the land, a song that still warms the blood
like wine, the Marseillaise.  Before that chant and the
leaping columns of French bayonets and their enthusiastically
served guns the foreign armies rolled back; before the end of
1792 the French armies had gone far beyond the utmost
achievements of Louis XIV; everywhere they stood on <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P344"></a>344}</span>foreign soil.
  They were in Brussels, they had overrun Savoy, they had
raided to Mayence; they had seized the Scheldt from Holland.
  Then the French Government did an unwise thing.  It had been
exasperated by the expulsion of its representative from
England upon the execution of Louis, and it declared war
against England.  It was an unwise thing to do, because the
revolution which had given France a new enthusiastic infantry
and a brilliant artillery released from its aristocratic
officers and many cramping conditions had destroyed the
discipline of the navy, and the English were supreme upon the
sea.  And this provocation united all England against France,
whereas there had been at first a very considerable liberal
movement in Great Britain in sympathy with the revolution.

<p>
Of the fight that France made in the next few years against a
European coalition we cannot tell in any detail.  She drove
the Austrians for ever out of Belgium, and made Holland a
republic.  The Dutch fleet, frozen in the Texel, surrendered
to a handful of <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P345"></a>345}</span>cavalry without firing its guns.
  For some time the French thrust towards Italy was hung up,
and it was only in 1796 that a new general, Napoleon
Bonaparte, led the ragged and hungry republican armies in
triumph across Piedmont to Mantua and Verona.  Says C. F.
  Atkinson,  [<a name="chapLVfn1text"></a><a
href="#chapLVfn1">1</a>] &ldquo;What astonished the Allies
most of all was the number and the velocity of the
Republicans.  These improvised armies had in fact nothing to
delay them.  Tents were unprocurable for want of money,
untransportable for want of the enormous number of wagons
that would have been required, and also unnecessary, for the
discomfort that would have caused wholesale desertion in
professional armies was cheerfully borne by the men of 1793-
94.   Supplies for armies of then unheard-of size could not
be carried in convoys, and the French soon became familiar
with &lsquo;living on the country.&rsquo;  Thus 1793 saw the
birth of the modern system of war&#8212;rapidity of movement,
full development of national strength, bivouacs, requisitions
and force as against cautious man&#339;uvring, small
professional armies, tents and full rations, and chicane.
  The first represented the decision-compelling spirit, the
second the spirit of risking little to gain a little ...
  .&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And while these ragged hosts of enthusiasts were chanting the
Marseillaise and fighting for <i>la France</i>, manifestly
never quite clear in their minds whether they were looting or
liberating the countries into which they poured, the
republican enthusiasm in Paris was spending itself in a far
less glorious fashion.  The revolution was now under the sway
of a fanatical leader, Robespierre.  This man is difficult to
judge; he was a man of poor physique, naturally timid, and a
prig.  But he had that most necessary gift for power, faith.
  He set himself to save the Republic as he conceived it, and
he imagined it could be saved by no other man than he.  So
that to keep in power was to save the Republic.  The living
spirit of the Republic, it seemed, had sprung from a
slaughter of royalists and the execution of the king.  There
were insurrections; one in the west, in the district of La
Vend&#233;e, where the people rose against the conscription
and against the dispossession of the orthodox clergy, and
were led by noblemen and priests; one in the south, where
Lyons and Marseilles had risen and the royalists of
Toulon<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P346"></a>346}</span>
had admitted an English and Spanish garrison.  To which there
seemed no more effectual reply than to go on killing
royalists.
</p>

<p>
The Revolutionary Tribunal went to work, and a steady
slaughtering began.  The invention of the guillotine was
opportune to this mood.  The queen was guillotined, most of
Robespierre&rsquo;s antagonists were guillotined, atheists
who argued that there was no Supreme Being were guillotined;
day by day, week by week, this infernal new machine chopped
off heads and more heads and more.  The reign of Robespierre
lived, it seemed, on blood; and needed more and more, as an
opium-taker needs more and more opium.

<p>
Finally in the summer of 1794 Robespierre himself was
overthrown and guillotined.  He was succeeded by a Directory
of five men which carried on the war of defence abroad and
held France together at home for five years.  Their reign
formed a curious interlude in this history of violent
changes.  They took things <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P347"></a>347}</span>as they found them.  The
propagandist zeal of the revolution carried the French armies
into Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, south Germany and north
Italy.  Everywhere kings were expelled and republics set up.
  But such propagandist zeal as animated the Directorate did
not prevent the looting of the treasures of the liberated
peoples to relieve the financial embarrassment of the French
Government.  Their wars became less and less the holy wars of
freedom, and more and more like the aggressive wars of the
ancient regime.  The last feature of Grand Monarchy that
France was disposed to discard was her tradition of foreign
policy.  One discovers it still as vigorous under the
Directorate as if there had been no revolution.
</p>

<p>
Unhappily for France and the world a man arose who embodied
in its intensest form this national egotism of the French.
  He gave that country ten years of glory and the humiliation
of a final defeat.  This was that same Napoleon Bonaparte who
had led the armies of the Directory to victory in Italy.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the five years of the Directorate he had been
scheming and working for self-advancement.  Gradually he
clambered to supreme power.  He was a man of severely limited
understanding but of ruthless directness and great energy.
  He had begun life as an extremist of the school of
Robespierre; he owed his first promotion to that side; but he
had no real grasp of the new forces that were working in
Europe.  His utmost political imagination carried him to a
belated and tawdry attempt to restore the Western Empire.  He
tried to destroy the remains of the old Holy Roman Empire,
intending to replace it by a new one centring upon Paris.
  The Emperor in Vienna ceased to be the Holy Roman Emperor and
became simply Emperor of Austria.  Napoleon divorced his
French wife in order to marry an Austrian princess.
</p>

<p>
He became practically monarch of France as First Consul in
1799, and he made himself Emperor of France in 1804 in direct
imitation of Charlemagne.  He was crowned by the Pope in
Paris, taking the crown from the Pope and putting it upon his
own head himself as Charlemagne had directed.  His son was
crowned King of Rome.
</p>

<p>
For some years Napoleon&rsquo;s reign was a career of
victory.  He <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P348"></a>348}</span>conquered most of Italy and Spain,
defeated Prussia and Austria, and dominated all Europe west
of Russia.  But he never won the command of the sea from the
British and his fleets sustained a conclusive defeat
inflicted by the British Admiral Nelson at Trafalgar (1805).
  Spain rose against him in 1808 and a British army under
Wellington thrust the French armies slowly northward out of
the peninsula.  In 1811 Napoleon came into conflict with the
Tsar Alexander I, and in 1812 he invaded Russia with a great
conglomerate army of 600,000 men, that was defeated and
largely destroyed by the Russians and the Russian winter.
  Germany rose against him, Sweden turned against him.  The
French armies were beaten back and at Fontainebleau Napoleon
abdicated (1814).  He was exiled to Elba, returned to France
for one last effort in 1815 and was defeated by the allied
British, Belgians and Prussians at Waterloo.  He died a
British prisoner at St. Helena in 1821.
</p>

<p>
The forces released by the French revolution were wasted and
finished.  A great Congress of the victorious allies met at
Vienna to restore as far as possible the state of affairs
that the great storm had rent to pieces.  For nearly forty
years a sort of peace, a peace of exhausted effort, was
maintained in Europe.

<h4 align="center">THE UNEASY PEACE IN EUROPE THAT FOLLOWED
THE FALL OF NAPOLEON</h4>

<p>

TWO main causes prevented that period from being a complete
social and international peace, and prepared the way for the
cycle of wars between 1854 and 1871.  The first of these was
the tendency of the royal courts concerned, towards the
restoration of unfair privilege and interference with freedom
of thought and writing and teaching.  The second was the
impossible system of boundaries drawn by the diplomatists of
Vienna.
</p>

<p>
The inherent disposition of monarchy to march back towards
past conditions was first and most particularly manifest in
Spain.  Here even the Inquisition was restored.  Across the
Atlantic the Spanish colonies had followed the example of the
United States and revolted against the European Great Power
System, when Napoleon set his brother Joseph on the Spanish
throne in 1810.  The George Washington of South America was
General Bolivar.  Spain was unable to suppress this revolt,
it dragged on much as the United States War of Independence
had dragged on, and at last the suggestion was made by
Austria, in accordance with the spirit of the Holy Alliance,
that the European monarch should assist Spain in this
struggle.  This was opposed by Britain in Europe, but it was
the prompt action of President Monroe of the United States in
1823 which conclusively warned off this projected monarchist
restoration.  He announced that the United States would
regard any extension of the European system in the Western
Hemisphere as a hostile act.  Thus arose the Monroe Doctrine,
the doctrine that there must be no extension of extra-
American government in America, which has kept the Great
Power system out of America for nearly a hundred years and
permitted the new states of Spanish America to work out their
destinies along their own lines.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P350"></a>350}</span>But if
Spanish monarchism lost its colonies, it could at least,
under the protection of the Concert of Europe, do what it
chose in Europe.  A popular insurrection in Spain was crushed
by a French army in 1823, with a mandate from a European
congress, and simultaneously Austria suppressed a revolution
in Naples.
</p>

<p>
In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by Charles X.
  Charles set himself to destroy the liberty of the press and
universities, and to restore absolute government; the sum of
a billion francs was voted to compensate the nobles for the
chateau burnings and sequestrations of 1789.  In 1830 Paris
rose against this embodiment of the ancient regime, and
replaced him by Louis Philippe, the son of that Philip, Duke
of Orleans, who was executed during the Terror.  The other
continental monarchies, in face of the open approval of the
revolution by Great Britain and a strong liberal ferment in
Germany and Austria, did not interfere in this affair.  After
all, France was still a monarchy.  This man Louis Philippe
(1830-48) remained the constitutional King of France for
eighteen years.
</p>

<p>
Such were the uneasy swayings of the peace of the Congress of
Vienna, which were provoked by the reactionary proceedings of
the monarchists.  The stresses that arose from the
unscientific boundaries planned by the diplomatists at Vienna
gathered force more deliberately, but they were even more
dangerous to the peace of mankind.  It is extraordinarily
inconvenient to administer together the affairs of peoples
speaking different languages and so reading different
literatures and having different general ideas, especially if
those differences are exacerbated by religious disputes.
  Only some strong mutual interest, such as the common
defensive needs of the Swiss mountaineers, can justify a
close linking of peoples of dissimilar languages and faiths;
and even in Switzerland there is the utmost local autonomy.
  When, as in Macedonia, populations are mixed in a patchwork
of villages and districts, the cantonal system is
imperatively needed.  But if the reader will look at the map
of Europe as the Congress of Vienna drew it, he will see that
this gathering seems almost as if it had planned the maximum
of local exasperation.
</p>

<p>
It destroyed the Dutch Republic, quite needlessly, it lumped
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P351"></a>351}</span>together
the Protestant Dutch with the French-speaking Catholics of
the old Spanish (Austrian) Netherlands, and set up a kingdom
of the Netherlands.  It handed over not merely the old
republic of Venice, but all of North Italy as far as Milan to
the German-speaking Austrians.  French-speaking Savoy it
combined with pieces of Italy to restore the kingdom of
Sardinia.  Austria and Hungary, already a sufficiently
explosive mixture of discordant nationalities, Germans,
Hungarians, Czecho-Slovaks, Jugo-Slavs, Roumanians, and now
Italians, was made still more impossible by confirming
Austria&rsquo;s Polish acquisitions of 1772 and 1795.  The
Catholic and republican-spirited Polish people were chiefly
given over to the less civilized rule of the Greek-orthodox
Tsar, but important districts went to Protestant Prussia.
  The Tsar was also confirmed in his acquisition of the
entirely alien Finns.  The very dissimilar Norwegian and
Swedish peoples were bound together under one king.  Germany,
the reader will see, was left in a particularly dangerous
state of muddle.  Prussia and Austria were both partly in and
partly out of a German confederation, which included a
multitude of minor states.  The King of Denmark came into the
German confederation by virtue of certain German-speaking
possessions in Holstein.  Luxembourg was included in the
German confederation, though its ruler was also King of the
Netherlands, and though many of its peoples talked French.
</p>

<p>
Here was a complete disregard of the fact that the people who
talk German and base their ideas on German literature, the
people who talk Italian and base their ideas on Italian
literature, and the people who talk Polish and base their
ideas on Polish literature, will all be far better off and
most helpful and least obnoxious to the rest of mankind if
they conduct their own affairs in their own idiom within the
ring-fence of their own speech.  Is it any wonder that one of
the most popular songs in Germany during this period declared
that wherever the German tongue was spoken, there was the
German Fatherland!

In 1830 French-speaking Belgium, stirred up by the current
revolution in France, revolted against its Dutch association
in the kingdom of the Netherlands.  The powers, terrified at
the possibilities of a republic or of annexation to France,
hurried in to pacify <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P353"></a>353}</span>this situation, and gave the
Belgians a monarch, Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg Gotha.  There
were also ineffectual revolts in Italy and Germany in 1830,
and a much more serious one in Russian Poland.  A republican
government held out in Warsaw for a year against Nicholas I
(who succeeded Alexander in 1825), and was then stamped out
of existence with great violence and cruelty.  The Polish
language was banned, and the Greek Orthodox church was
substituted for the Roman Catholic as the state religion ....

In 1821 there was an insurrection of the Greeks against the
Turks.  For six years they fought a desperate war, while the
governments of Europe looked on.  Liberal opinion protested
against this inactivity; volunteers from every European
country joined the insurgents, and at last Britain, France
and Russia took joint action.  The Turkish fleet was
destroyed by the French and English at the battle of Navarino
(1827), and the Tsar invaded Turkey.  By the treaty of
Adrianople (1829) Greece was declared free, but <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P354"></a>354}</span>she was not
permitted to resume her ancient republican traditions.  A
German king was found for Greece, one Prince Otto of Bavaria,
and Christian governors were set up in the Danubian provinces
(which are now Roumania) and Serbia (a part of the Jugo-Slav
region).  Much blood had still to run however before the Turk
was altogether expelled from these lands.

<h4 align="center">THE DEVELOPMENT OF MATERIAL KNOWLEDGE</h4>

<p>

THROUGHOUT the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the
opening years of the nineteenth century, while these
conflicts of the powers and princes were going on in Europe,
and the patchwork of the treaty of Westphalia (1648) was
changing kaleidoscopically into the patchwork of the treaty
of Vienna (1815), and while the sailing ship was spreading
European influence throughout the world, a steady growth of
knowledge and a general clearing up of men&rsquo;s ideas
about the world in which they lived was in progress in the
European and Europeanized world.
</p>

<p>
It went on disconnected from political life, and producing
throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries no
striking immediate results in political life.  Nor was it
affecting popular thought very profoundly during this period.
  These reactions were to come later, and only in their full
force in the latter half of the nineteenth century.  It was a
process that went on chiefly in a small world of prosperous
and independent-spirited people.  Without what the English
call the &ldquo;private gentleman,&rdquo; the scientific
process could not have begun in Greece, and could not have
been renewed in Europe.  The universities played a part but
not a leading part in the philosophical and scientific
thought of this period.  Endowed learning is apt to be timid
and conservative learning, lacking in initiative and
resistent to innovation, unless it has the spur of contact
with independent minds.
</p>

<p>
We have already noted the formation of the Royal Society in
1662 and its work in realizing the dream of Bacon&rsquo;s
<i>New Atlantis</i>.  Throughout the eighteenth century there
was much clearing up of general ideas about matter and
motion, much mathematical advance, a systematic development
of the use of optical glass in microscope and telescope, a
renewed energy in classificatory natural <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P356"></a>356}</span>history, a
great revival of anatomical science.  The science of
geology&#8212;foreshadowed by Aristotle and anticipated by
Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)&#8212;began its great task of
interpreting the Record of the Rocks.

The progress of physical science reacted upon metallurgy.
  Improved metallurgy, affording the possibility of a larger
and bolder handling of masses of metal and other materials,
reacted upon practical inventions.  Machinery on a new scale
and in a new abundance appeared to revolutionize industry.
</p>

<p>
In 1804 Trevithick adapted the Watt engine to transport and
made the first locomotive.  In 1825 the first railway,
between Stockton and Darlington, was opened, and
Stephenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rocket,&rdquo; with a thirteen-ton
train, got up to a speed of forty-four miles per hour.  From
1830 onward railways multiplied.  By the middle of the
century a network of railways had spread all over Europe.

<p>
Here was a sudden change in what had long been a fixed
condition of human life, the maximum rate of land transport.
  After the Russian disaster, Napoleon travelled from near
Vilna to Paris in 312 hours.  This was a journey of about
1,400 miles.  He was travelling with every conceivable
advantage, and he averaged <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P357"></a>357}</span>under 5 miles an hour.  An
ordinary traveller could not have done this distance in twice
the time.  These were about the same maximum rates of travel
as held good between Rome and Gaul in the first century
 <small>A.D.</small>  Then suddenly came this tremendous
change.  The railways reduced this journey for any ordinary
traveller to less than forty-eight hours.  That is to say,
they reduced the chief European distances to about a tenth of
what they had been.  They made it possible to carry out
administrative work in areas ten times as great as any that
had hitherto been workable under one administration.  The
full significance of that possibility in Europe still remains
to be realized.  Europe is still netted in boundaries drawn
in the horse and road era.  In America the effects were
immediate.  To the United States of America, sprawling
westward, it meant the possibility of a continuous access to
Washington, however far the frontier travelled across the
continent.  It meant unity, sustained on a scale that would
otherwise have been impossible.

<p>
The steamboat was, if anything, a little ahead of the steam
engine in its earlier phases.  There was a steamboat, the
<i>Charlotte Dundas</i>, on the Firth of Clyde Canal in 1802,
and in 1807 an American <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P358"></a>358}</span>named Fulton had a steamer, the
Clermont, with British-built engines, upon the Hudson River
above New York.  The first steamship to put to sea was also
an American, the Ph&#339;nix, which went from New York
(Hoboken) to Philadelphia.  So, too, was the first ship using
steam (she also had sails) to cross the Atlantic, the
Savannah (1819).  All these were paddle-wheel boats and
paddle-wheel boats are not adapted to work in heavy seas.
  The paddles smash too easily, and the boat is then disabled.
  The screw steamship followed rather slowly.  Many
difficulties had to be surmounted before the screw was a
practicable thing.  Not until the middle of the century did
the tonnage of steamships upon the sea begin to overhaul that
of sailing ships.  After that the evolution in sea transport
was rapid.  For the first time men began to cross the seas
and oceans with some certainty as to the date of their
arrival.  The transatlantic crossing, which had been an
uncertain adventure of several weeks&#8212;which might
stretch to months&#8212;was accelerated, until in 1910 it was
brought down, in the case of the fastest boats, to under five
days, with a practically notifiable hour of arrival.
</p>

<p>
Concurrently with the development of steam transport upon
land and sea a new and striking addition to the facilities of
human intercourse arose out of the investigations of Volta,
Galvani and Faraday into various electrical phenomena.  The
electric telegraph came into existence in 1835.  The first
underseas cable was laid in 1851 between France and England.
  In a few years the telegraph system had spread over the
civilized world, and news which had hitherto travelled slowly
from point to point became practically simultaneous
throughout the earth.
</p>

<p>
These things, the steam railway and the electric telegraph,
were to the popular imagination of the middle nineteenth
century the most striking and revolutionary of inventions,
but they were only the most conspicuous and clumsy first
fruits of a far more extensive process.  Technical knowledge
and skill were developing with an extraordinary rapidity, and
to an extraordinary extent measured by the progress of any
previous age.  Far less conspicuous at first in everyday
life, but finally far more important, was the extension of
man&rsquo;s power over various structural materials.  Before
the middle of the eighteenth century iron was reduced from
its ores by <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P359"></a>359}</span>means of wood charcoal, was
handled in small pieces, and hammered and wrought into shape.
  It was material for a craftsman.  Quality and treatment were
enormously dependent upon the experience and sagacity of the
individual iron-worker.  The largest masses of iron that
could be dealt with under those conditions amounted at most
(in the sixteenth century) to two or three tons.  (There was
a very definite upward limit, therefore, to the size of
cannon.)  The blast-furnace rose in the eighteenth century
and developed with the use of coke.  Not before the
eighteenth century do we find rolled sheet iron (1728) and
rolled rods and bars (1783).  Nasmyth&rsquo;s steam hammer
came as late as 1838.
</p>

<p>
The ancient world, because of its metallurgical inferiority,
could not use steam.  The steam engine, even the primitive
pumping engine, could not develop before sheet iron was
available.  The early engines seem to the modern eye very
pitiful and clumsy bits of ironmongery, but they were the
utmost that the metallurgical science of the time could do.
  As late as 1856 came the Bessemer process, and presently
(1864) the open-hearth process, in which steel and every sort
of iron could be melted, purified and cast in a manner and
upon a scale hitherto unheard of.  To-day in the electric
furnace one may see tons of incandescent steel swirling about
like boiling milk in a saucepan.  Nothing in the previous
practical advances of mankind is comparable in its
consequences to the complete mastery over enormous masses of
steel and iron and over their texture and quality which man
has now achieved.  The railways and early engines of all
sorts were the mere first triumphs of the new metallurgical
methods.  Presently came ships of iron and steel, vast
bridges, and a new way of building with steel upon a gigantic
scale.  Men realized too late that they had planned their
railways with far too timid a gauge, that they could have
organized their travelling with far more steadiness and
comfort upon a much bigger scale.
</p>

<p>
Before the nineteenth century there were no ships in the
world much over 2,000 tons burthen; now there is nothing
wonderful about a 50,000-ton liner.  There are people who
sneer at this kind of progress as being a progress in
&ldquo;mere size,&rdquo; but that sort of sneering merely
marks the intellectual limitations of those who indulge in
it.  <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P360"></a>360}</span>The
great ship or the steel-frame building is not, as they
imagine, a magnified version of the small ship or building of
the past; it is a thing different in kind, more lightly and
strongly built, of finer and stronger materials; instead of
being a thing of precedent and rule-of-thumb, it is a thing
of subtle and intricate calculation.  In the old house or
ship, matter was dominant&#8212;the material and its needs
had to be slavishly obeyed; in the new, matter had been
captured, changed, coerced.  Think of the coal and iron and
sand dragged out of the banks and pits, wrenched, wrought,
molten and cast, to be flung at last, a slender glittering
pinnacle of steel and glass, six hundred feet above the
crowded city!
</p>

<p>
We have given these particulars of the advance in man&rsquo;s
knowledge of the metallurgy of steel and its results by way
of illustration.  A parallel story could be told of the
metallurgy of copper and tin, and of a multitude of metals,
nickel and aluminium to name but two, unknown before the
nineteenth century dawned.  It is in this great and growing
mastery over substances, over different sorts of glass, over
rocks and plasters and the like, over colours and textures,
that the main triumphs of the mechanical revolution have thus
far been achieved.  Yet we are still in the stage of the
first fruits in the matter.  We have the power, but we have
still to learn how to use our power.  Many of the first
employments of these gifts of science have been vulgar,
tawdry, stupid or horrible.  The artist and the adaptor have
still hardly begun to work with the endless variety of
substances now at their disposal.
</p>

<p>
Parallel with this extension of mechanical possibilities the
new science of electricity grew up.  It was only in the
eighties of the nineteenth century that this body of enquiry
began to yield results to impress the vulgar mind.  Then
suddenly came electric light and electric traction, and the
transmutation of forces, the possibility of sending power,
that could be changed into mechanical motion or light or heat
as one chose, along a copper wire, as water is sent along a
pipe, began to come through to the ideas of ordinary
people....
</p>

<p>
The British and French were at first the leading peoples in
this great proliferation of knowledge; but presently the
Germans, who had learnt humility under Napoleon, showed such
zeal and pertinacity in scientific enquiry as to overhaul
these leaders.  British <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P361"></a>361}</span>science was largely the creation
of Englishmen and Scotchmen working outside the ordinary
centres of erudition.

The universities of Britain were at this time in a state of
educational retrogression, largely given over to a pedantic
conning of the Latin and Greek classics.  French education,
too, was dominated by the classical tradition of the Jesuit
schools, and consequently it was not difficult for the
Germans to organize a body of investigators, small indeed in
relation to the possibilities of the case, but large in
proportion to the little band of British and French inventors
and experimentalists.  And though this work of research and
experiment was making Britain and France the most rich and
powerful countries in the world, it was not making scientific
and inventive men rich and <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P362"></a>362}</span>powerful.  There is a necessary
unworldliness about a sincere scientific man; he is too
preoccupied with his research to plan and scheme how to make
money out of it.  The economic exploitation of his
discoveries falls very easily and naturally, therefore, into
the hands of a more acquisitive type; and so we find that the
crops of rich men which every fresh phase of scientific and
technical progress has produced in Great Britain, though they
have not displayed quite the same passionate desire to insult
and kill the goose that laid the national golden eggs as the
scholastic and clerical professions, have been quite content
to let that profitable creature starve.  Inventors and
discoverers came by nature, they thought, for cleverer people
to profit by.
</p>

<p>
In this matter the Germans were a little wiser.  The German
&ldquo;learned&rdquo; did not display the same vehement
hatred of the new learning.  They permitted its development.
  The German business man and manufacturer again had not quite
the same contempt for the man of science as had his British
competitor.  Knowledge, these Germans believed, might be a
cultivated crop, responsive to fertilizers.  They did
concede, therefore, a certain amount of opportunity to the
scientific mind; their public expenditure on scientific work
was relatively greater, and this expenditure was abundantly
rewarded.  By the latter half of the nineteenth century the
German scientific worker had made German a necessary language
for every science student who wished to keep abreast with the
latest work in his department, and in certain branches, and
particularly in chemistry, Germany acquired a very great
superiority over her western neighbours.  The scientific
effort of the sixties and seventies in Germany began to tell
after the eighties, and the German gained steadily upon
Britain and France in technical and industrial prosperity.
</p>

<p>
A fresh phase in the history of invention opened when in the
eighties a new type of engine came into use, an engine in
which the expansive force of an explosive mixture replaced
the expansive force of steam.  The light, highly efficient
engines that were thus made possible were applied to the
automobile, and developed at last to reach such a pitch of
lightness and efficiency as to render flight&#8212;<span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P363"></a>363}</span>long known to
be possible&#8212;a practical achievement.  A successful
flying machine&#8212;but not a machine large enough to take
up a human body&#8212;was made by Professor Langley of the
Smithsonian Institute of Washington as early as 1897.  By
1909 the aeroplane was available for human locomotion.  There
had seemed to be a pause in the increase of human speed with
the perfection of railways and automobile road traction, but
with the flying machine came fresh reductions in the
effective distance between one point of the earth&rsquo;s
surface and another.  In the eighteenth century the distance
from London to Edinburgh was an eight days&rsquo; journey; in
1918 the British Civil Air Transport Commission reported that
the journey from London to Melbourne, halfway round the
earth, would probably in a few years&rsquo; time be
accomplished in that same period of eight days.

</center>

<p>
Too much stress must not be laid upon these striking
reductions in the time distances of one place from another.
  They are merely one aspect of a much profounder and more
momentous enlargement of human possibility.  The science of
agriculture and agricultural chemistry, for instance, made
quite parallel advances during the nineteenth century.  Men
learnt so to fertilize the soil as to produce quadruple and
quintuple the crops got from the same area in the seventeenth
century.  There was a still more extraordinary advance in
medical science; the average duration of life rose, the daily
efficiency increased, the waste of life through ill-health
diminished.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P364"></a>364}</span>Now here
altogether we have such a change in human life as to
constitute a fresh phase of history.  In a little more than a
century this mechanical revolution has been brought about.
  In that time man made a stride in the material conditions of
his life vaster than he had done during the whole long
interval between the pal&#230;olithic stage and the age of
cultivation, or between the days of Pepi in Egypt and those
of George III.  A new gigantic material framework for human
affairs has come into existence.  Clearly it demands great
readjustments of our social, economical and political
methods.  But these readjustments have necessarily waited
upon the development of the mechanical revolution, and they
are still only in their opening stage to-day.

<h4 align="center">THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION</h4>

<p>

THERE is a tendency in many histories to confuse together
what we have here called the mechanical revolution, which was
an entirely new thing in human experience arising out of the
development of organized science, a new step like the
invention of agriculture or the discovery of metals, with
something else, quite different in its origins, something for
which there was already an historical precedent, the social
and financial development which is called the <i>industrial
revolution</i>.  The two processes were going on together,
they were constantly reacting upon each other, but they were
in root and essence different.  There would have been an
industrial revolution of sorts if there had been no coal, no
steam, no machinery; but in that case it would probably have
followed far more closely upon the lines of the social and
financial developments of the later years of the Roman
Republic.  It would have repeated the story of dispossessed
free cultivators, gang labour, great estates, great financial
fortunes, and a socially destructive financial process.  Even
the factory method came before power and machinery.
  Factories were the product not of machinery, but of the
&ldquo;division of labour.&rdquo;  Drilled and sweated
workers were making such things as millinery cardboard boxes
and furniture, and colouring maps and book illustrations and
so forth, before even water-wheels had been used for
industrial purposes.  There were factories in Rome in the
days of Augustus.  New books, for instance, were dictated to
rows of copyists in the factories of the book-sellers.  The
attentive student of Defoe and of the political pamphlets of
Fielding will realize that the idea of herding poor people
into establishments to work collectively for their living was
already current in Britain before the close of the
seventeenth century.  There are intimations of it even as
early as More&rsquo;s <i>Utopia</i> (1516).  It was a social
and not a mechanical development.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P366"></a>366}</span>Up to
past the middle of the eighteenth century the social and
economic history of western Europe was in fact retreading the
path along which the Roman state had gone in the last three
centuries <small>B.C.</small>  But the political
disunions of Europe, the political convulsions against
monarchy, the recalcitrance of the common folk and perhaps
also the greater accessibility of the western European
intelligence to mechanical ideas and inventions, turned the
process into quite novel directions.  Ideas of human
solidarity, thanks to Christianity, were far more widely
diffused in the newer European world, political power was not
so concentrated, and the man of energy anxious to get rich
turned his mind, therefore, very willingly from the ideas of
the slave and of gang labour to the idea of mechanical power
and the machine.
</p>

<p>
The mechanical revolution, the process of mechanical
invention and discovery, was a new thing in human experience
and it went on regardless of the social, political, economic
and industrial consequences it might produce.  The industrial
revolution, on the other hand, like most other human affairs,
was and is more and more profoundly changed and deflected by
the constant variation in human conditions caused by the
mechanical revolution.  And the essential difference between
the amassing of riches, the extinction of small farmers and
small business men, and the phase of big finance in the
latter centuries of the Roman Republic on the one hand, and
the very similar concentration of capital in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries on the other, lies in the profound
difference in the character of labour that the mechanical
revolution was bringing about.  The power of the old world
was human power; everything depended ultimately upon the
driving power of human muscle, the muscle of ignorant and
subjugated men.  A little animal muscle, supplied by draft
oxen, horse traction and the like, contributed.  Where a
weight had to be lifted, men lifted it; where a rock had to
be quarried, men chipped it out; where a field had to be
ploughed, men and oxen ploughed it; the Roman equivalent of
the steamship was the galley with its bank of sweating
rowers.  A vast proportion of mankind in the early
civilizations were employed in purely mechanical drudgery.
  At its onset, power-driven machinery did not seem to promise
any release from such unintelligent toil.  Great gangs <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P367"></a>367}</span>of men were
employed in excavating canals, in making railway cuttings and
embankments, and the like.  The number of miners increased
enormously.  But the extension of facilities and the output
of commodities increased much more.  And as the nineteenth
century went on, the plain logic of the new situation
asserted itself more clearly.  Human beings were no longer
wanted as a source of mere indiscriminated power.  What could
be done mechanically by a human being could be done faster
and better by a machine.  The human being was needed now only
where choice and intelligence had to be exercised.  Human
beings were wanted only as human beings.  The drudge, on whom
all the previous civilizations had rested, the creature of
mere obedience, the man whose brains were superfluous, had
become unnecessary to the welfare of mankind.

<p>
This was as true of such ancient industries as agriculture
and mining as it was of the newest metallurgical processes.
  For ploughing, sowing and harvesting, swift machines came
forward to do the work of scores of men.  The Roman
civilization was built upon <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P368"></a>368}</span>cheap and degraded human beings;
modern civilization is being rebuilt upon cheap mechanical
power.  For a hundred years power has been getting cheaper
and labour dearer.  If for a generation or so machinery has
had to wait its turn in the mine, it is simply because for a
time men were cheaper than machinery.

<p>
Now here was a change-over of quite primary importance in
human affairs.  The chief solicitude of the rich and of the
ruler in the old civilization had been to keep up a supply of
drudges.  As the nineteenth century went on, it became more
and more plain to the intelligent directive people that the
common man had now to be something better than a drudge.  He
had to be educated&#8212;if only to secure &ldquo;industrial
efficiency.&rdquo;  He had to understand what he was about.
  From the days of the first Christian propaganda, popular
education had been smouldering in Europe, just as it had
smouldered in Asia wherever Islam has set its foot, because
of the necessity of making the believer understand a little
of the belief by which he is <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P369"></a>369}</span>saved, and of enabling him to read
a little in the sacred books by which his belief is conveyed.
  Christian controversies, with their competition for
adherents, ploughed the ground for the harvest of popular
education.  In England, for instance, by the thirties and
forties of the nineteenth century, the disputes of the sects
and the necessity of catching adherents young had produced a
series of competing educational organizations for children,
the church &ldquo;National&rdquo; schools, the dissenting
&ldquo;British&rdquo; schools, and even Roman Catholic
elementary schools.  The second half of the nineteenth
century was a period of rapid advance in popular education
throughout all the Westernized world.  There was no parallel
advance in the education of the upper classes&#8212;some
advance, no doubt, but nothing to correspond&#8212;and so the
great gulf that had divided that world hitherto into the
readers and the non-reading mass became little more than a
slightly perceptible difference in educational level.  At the
back of this process was the mechanical revolution,
apparently regardless of social conditions, but really
insisting inexorably upon the complete abolition of a totally
illiterate class throughout the world.
</p>

<p>
The economic revolution of the Roman Republic had never been
clearly apprehended by the common people of Rome.  The
ordinary Roman citizen never saw the changes through which he
lived, clearly and comprehensively as we see them.  But the
industrial revolution, as it went on towards the end of the
nineteenth century, was more and more distinctly <i>seen</i>
as one whole process by the common people it was affecting,
because presently they could read and discuss and
communicate, and because they went about and saw things as no
commonalty had ever done before.

<h4 align="center">THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN POLITICAL AND
SOCIAL IDEAS</h4>

<p>

THE institutions and customs and political ideas of the
ancient civilizations grew up slowly, age by age, no man
designing and no man foreseeing.  It was only in that great
century of human adolescence, the sixth century
 <small>B.C.</small>, that men began to think clearly about their
relations to one another, and first to question and first
propose to alter and rearrange the established beliefs and
laws and methods of human government.
</p>

<p>
We have told of the glorious intellectual dawn of Greece and
Alexandria, and how presently the collapse of the slave-
holding civilizations and the clouds of religious intolerance
and absolutist government darkened the promise of that
beginning.  The light of fearless thinking did not break
through the European obscurity again effectually until the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  We have tried to show
something of the share of the great winds of Arab curiosity
and Mongol conquest in this gradual clearing of the mental
skies of Europe.  And at first it was chiefly material
knowledge that increased.  The first fruits of the recovered
manhood of the race were material achievements and material
power.  The science of human relationship, of individual and
social psychology, of education and of economics, are not
only more subtle and intricate in themselves but also bound
up inextricably with much emotional matter.  The advances
made in them have been slower and made against greater
opposition.  Men will listen dispassionately to the most
diverse suggestions about stars or molecules, but ideas about
our ways of life touch and reflect upon everyone about us.
</p>

<p>
And just as in Greece the bold speculations of Plato came
before Aristotle&rsquo;s hard search for fact, so in Europe
the first political enquiries of the new phase were put in
the form of &ldquo;Utopian&rdquo; stories, directly imitated
from Plato&rsquo;s <i>Republic</i> and his <i>Laws</i>.  Sir
Thomas <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P371"></a>371}</span>More&rsquo;s <i>Utopia</i> is a
curious imitation of Plato that bore fruit in a new English
poor law.  The Neapolitan Campanella&rsquo;s <i>City of the
Sun</i> was more fantastic and less fruitful.
</p>

<p>
By the end of the seventeenth century we find a considerable
and growing literature of political and social science was
being produced.  Among the pioneers in this discussion was
John Locke, the son of an English republican, an Oxford
scholar who first directed his attention to chemistry and
medicine.  His treatises on government, toleration and
education show a mind fully awake to the possibilities of
social reconstruction.  Parallel with and a little later than
John Locke in England, Montesquieu (1689-1755) in France
subjected social, political and religious institutions to a
searching and fundamental analysis.  He stripped the magical
prestige from the absolutist monarchy in France.  He shares
with Locke the credit for clearing away many of the false
ideas that had hitherto prevented deliberate and conscious
attempts to reconstruct human society.
</p>

<p>
The generation that followed him in the middle and later
decades of the eighteenth century was boldly speculative upon
the moral and intellectual clearings he had made.  A group of
brilliant writers, the &ldquo;Encyclop&#230;dists,&rdquo;
mostly rebel spirits from the excellent schools of the
Jesuits, set themselves to scheme out a new world (1766).
  Side by side with the Encyclop&#230;dists were the Economists
or Physiocrats, who were making bold and crude enquiries into
the production and distribution of food and goods.  Morelly,
the author of the <i>Code de La Nature</i>, denounced the
institution of private property and proposed a communistic
organization of society.  He was the precursor of that large
and various school of collectivist thinkers in the nineteenth
century who are lumped together as Socialists.
</p>

<p>
What is Socialism?  There are a hundred definitions of
Socialism and a thousand sects of Socialists.  Essentially
Socialism is no more and no less than a criticism of the idea
of property in the light of the public good.  We may review
the history of that idea through the ages very briefly.  That
and the idea of internationalism are the two cardinal ideas
upon which most of our political life is turning.

<p>
The idea
of property arises out of the combative instincts of the
species.  Long before men were men, the ancestral ape was a
proprietor.  Primitive property is what a beast will fight
for.  The dog and his bone, the tigress and her lair, the
roaring stag and his herd, these are proprietorship blazing.
  No more nonsensical expression is conceivable in sociology
than the term &ldquo;primitive communism.&rdquo;  The Old Man
of the family tribe of early pal&#230;olithic times insisted
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P373"></a>373}</span>upon his
proprietorship in his wives and daughters, in his tools, in
his visible universe.  If any other man wandered into his
visible universe he fought him, and if he could he slew him.
  The tribe grew in the course of ages, as Atkinson showed
convincingly in his <i>Primal Law</i>, by the gradual
toleration by the Old Man of the existence of the younger
men, and of their proprietorship in the wives they captured
from outside the tribe, and in the tools and ornaments they
made and the game they slew.  Human society grew by a
compromise between this one&rsquo;s property and that.  It
was a compromise with instinct which was forced upon men by
the necessity of driving some other tribe out of its visible
universe.  If the hills and forests and streams were not
<i>your</i> land or <i>my</i> land, it was because they had
to be our land.  Each of us would have preferred to have it
<i>my</i> land, but that would not work.  In that case the
other fellows would have destroyed us.  Society, therefore,
is from its beginning a <i>mitigation of ownership</i>.
  Ownership in the beast and in the primitive savage was far
more intense a thing than it is in the civilized world to-
day.  It is rooted more strongly in our instincts than in our
reason.
</p>

<p>
In the natural savage and in the untutored man to-day there
is no limitation to the sphere of ownership.  Whatever you
can fight for, you can own; women-folk, spared captive,
captured beast, forest glade, stone-pit or what not.  As the
community grew, a sort of law came to restrain internecine
fighting, men developed rough-and-ready methods of settling
proprietorship.  Men could own what they were the first to
make or capture or claim.  It seemed natural that a debtor
who could not pay should become the property of his creditor.
  Equally natural was it that after claiming a patch of land a
man should exact payments from anyone who wanted to use it.
  It was only slowly, as the possibilities of organized life
dawned on men, that this unlimited property in anything
whatever began to be recognized as a nuisance.  Men found
themselves born into a universe all owned and claimed, nay!
they found themselves born owned and claimed.  The social
struggles of the earlier civilization are difficult to trace
now, but the history we have told of the Roman Republic shows
a community waking up to the idea that debts may become a
public inconvenience and should then be repudiated, and that
the unlimited ownership of land is also an inconvenience.  We
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P374"></a>374}</span>find
that later Babylonia severely limited the rights of property
in slaves.  Finally, we find in the teaching of that great
revolutionist, Jesus of Nazareth, such an attack upon
property as had never been before.  Easier it was, he said,
for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the
owner of great possessions to enter the kingdom of heaven.  A
steady, continuous criticism of the permissible scope of
property seems to have been going on in the world for the
last twenty-five or thirty centuries.  Nineteen hundred years
after Jesus of Nazareth we find all the world that has come
under the Christian teaching persuaded that there could be no
property in human beings.  And also the idea that a man may
&ldquo;do what he likes with his own&rdquo; was very much
shaken in relation to other sorts of property.
</p>

<p>
But this world of the closing eighteenth century was still
only in the interrogative stage in this matter.  It had got
nothing clear enough, much less settled enough, to act upon.
  One of its primary impulses was to protect property against
the greed and waste of kings and the exploitation of noble
adventurers.  It was largely to protect private property from
taxation that the French Revolution began.  But the
equalitarian formul&#230; of the Revolution carried it into a
criticism of the very property it had risen to protect.  How
can men be free and equal when numbers of them have no ground
to stand upon and nothing to eat, and the owners will neither
feed nor lodge them unless they toil?  Excessively&#8212;the
poor complained.
</p>

<p>
To which riddle the reply of one important political group
was to set about &ldquo;dividing up.&rdquo;  They wanted to
intensify and universalize property.  Aiming at the same end
by another route, there were the primitive
socialists&#8212;or, to be more exact, communists&#8212;who
wanted to &ldquo;abolish&rdquo; private property altogether.
  The state (a democratic state was of course understood) was
to own all property.
</p>

<p>
It is paradoxical that different men seeking the same ends of
liberty and happiness should propose on the one hand to make
property as absolute as possible, and on the other to put an
end to it altogether.  But so it was.  And the clue to this
paradox is to be found in the fact that ownership is not one
thing but a multitude of different things.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P375"></a>375}</span>It was
only as the nineteenth century developed that men began to
realize that property was not one simple thing, but a great
complex of ownerships of different values and consequences,
that many things (such as one&rsquo;s body, the implements of
an artist, clothing, toothbrushes) are very profoundly and
incurably one&rsquo;s personal property, and that there is a
very great range of things, railways, machinery of various
sorts, homes, cultivated gardens, pleasure boats, for
example, which need each to be considered very particularly
to determine how far and under what limitations it may come
under private ownership, and how far it falls into the public
domain and may be administered and let out by the state in
the collective interest.  On the practical side these
questions pass into politics, and the problem of making and
sustaining efficient state administration.  They open up
issues in social psychology, and interact with the enquiries
of educational science.  The criticism of property is still a
vast and passionate ferment rather than a science.  On the
one hand are the Individualists, who would protect and
enlarge our present freedoms with what we possess, and on the
other the Socialists who would in many directions pool our
ownerships and restrain our proprietory acts.  In practice
one will find every gradation between the extreme
individualist, who will scarcely tolerate a tax of any sort
to support a government, and the communist who would deny any
possessions at all.  The ordinary socialist of to-day is what
is called a collectivist; he would allow a considerable
amount of private property but put such affairs as education,
transport, mines, land-owning, most mass productions of
staple articles, and the like, into the hands of a highly
organized state.  Nowadays there does seem to be a gradual
convergence of reasonable men towards a moderate socialism
scientifically studied and planned.  It is realized more and
more clearly that the untutored man does not co-operate
easily and successfully in large undertakings, and that every
step towards a more complex state and every function that the
state takes over from private enterprise, necessitates a
corresponding educational advance and the organization of a
proper criticism and control.  Both the press and the
political methods of the contemporary state are far too crude
for any large extension of collective activities.
</p>

<p>
But for a time the stresses between employer and employed and
<span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P376"></a>376}</span>particularly between selfish
employers and reluctant workers, led to a world-wide
dissemination of the very harsh and elementary form of
communism which is associated with the name of Marx.  Marx
based his theories on a belief that men&rsquo;s minds are
limited by their economic necessities, and that there is a
necessary conflict of interests in our present civilization
between the prosperous and employing classes of people and
the employed mass.  With the advance in education
necessitated by the mechanical revolution, this great
employed majority will become more and more class-conscious
and more and more solid in antagonism to the (class-
conscious) ruling minority.  In some way the class-conscious
workers would seize power, he prophesied, and inaugurate a
new social state.  The antagonism, the insurrection, the
possible revolution are understandable enough, but it does
not follow that a new social state or anything but a socially
destructive process will ensue.  Put to the test in Russia,
Marxism, as we shall note later, has proved singularly
uncreative.

<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P377"></a>377}</span>Marx
sought to replace national antagonism by class antagonisms;
Marxism has produced in succession a First, a Second and a
Third Workers&rsquo; International.  But from the starting
point of modern individualistic thought it is also possible
to reach international ideas.  From the days of that great
English economist, Adam Smith, onward there has been an
increasing realization that for world-wide prosperity free
and unencumbered trade about the earth is needed.  The
individualist with his hostility to the state is hostile also
to tariffs and boundaries and all the restraints upon free
act and movement that national boundaries seem to justify.
  It is interesting to see two lines of thought, so diverse in
spirit, so different in substance as this class-war socialism
of the Marxists and the individualistic free-trading
philosophy of the British business men of the Victorian age
heading at last, in spite of these primary differences,
towards the same intimations of a new world-wide treatment of
human affairs outside the boundaries and limitations of any
existing state.  The logic of reality triumphs over the logic
of theory.  We begin to perceive that from widely divergent
starting points individualist theory and socialist theory are
part of a common search, a search for more spacious social
and political ideas and interpretations, upon which men may
contrive to work together, a search that began again in
Europe and has intensified as men&rsquo;s confidence in the
ideas of the Holy Roman Empire and in Christendom decayed,
and as the age of discovery broadened their horizons from the
world of the Mediterranean to the whole wide world.

<p>
To bring this description of the elaboration and development
of social, economic and political ideas right down to the
discussions of the present day, would be to introduce issues
altogether too controversial for the scope and intentions of
this book.  But regarding these things, as we do here, from
the vast perspectives of the student of world history, we are
bound to recognize that this reconstruction of these
directive ideas in the human mind is still an unfinished
task&#8212;we cannot even estimate yet how unfinished the
task may be.  Certain common beliefs do seem to be emerging,
and their influence is very perceptible upon the political
events and public acts of to-day; but at present they are not
clear enough nor convincing enough to compel men definitely
and systematically towards their realization.  <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P378"></a>378}</span>Men&rsquo;s
acts waver between tradition and the new, and on the whole
they rather gravitate towards the traditional.  Yet, compared
with the thought of even a brief lifetime ago, there does
seem to be an outline shaping itself of a new order in human
affairs.  It is a sketchy outline, vanishing into vagueness
at this point and that, <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P379"></a>379}</span>and fluctuating in detail and
formul&#230;, yet it grows steadfastly clearer, and its main
lines change less and less.

<p>
It is becoming plainer and plainer each year that in many
respects and in an increasing range of affairs, mankind is
becoming one community, and that it is more and more
necessary that in such matters there should be a common
world-wide control.  For example, it is steadily truer that
the whole planet is now one economic community, that the
proper exploitation of its natural resources demands one
comprehensive direction, and that the greater power and range
that discovery has given human effort makes the present
fragmentary and contentious administration of such affairs
more and more wasteful and dangerous.  Financial and monetary
expedients also become world-wide interests to be dealt with
successfully only on world-wide lines.  Infectious diseases
and the increase and migrations of population are also now
plainly seen to be world-wide concerns.  The greater power
and range of human activities has also made war
disproportionately destructive and disorganizing, and, even
as a clumsy way of settling issues between government and
government and people and people, ineffective.  All these
things clamour for controls and authorities of a greater
range and greater comprehensiveness than any government that
has hitherto existed.
</p>

<p>
But it does not follow that the solution of these problems
lies in some super-government of all the world arising by
conquest or by the coalescence of existing governments.  By
analogy with existing institutions men have thought of the
Parliament of Mankind, of a World Congress, of a President or
Emperor of the Earth.  Our first natural reaction is towards
some such conclusion, but the discussion and experiences of
half a century of suggestions and attempts has on the whole
discouraged belief in that first obvious idea.  Along that
line to world unity the resistances are too great.  The drift
of thought seems now to be in the direction of a number of
special committees or organizations, with world-wide power
delegated to them by existing governments in this group of
matters or that, bodies concerned with the waste or
development of natural wealth, with the equalization of
labour conditions, with world peace, with currency,
population and health, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P380"></a>380}</span>The
world may discover that all its common interests are being
managed as one concern, while it still fails to realize that
a world government exists.  But before even so much human
unity is attained, before such international arrangements can
be put above patriotic suspicions and jealousies, it is
necessary that the common mind of the race should be
possessed of that idea of human unity, and that the idea of
mankind as one family should be a matter of universal
instruction and understanding.
</p>

<p>
For a score of centuries or more the spirit of the great
universal religions has been struggling to maintain and
extend that idea of a universal human brotherhood, but to
this day the spites, angers and distrusts of tribal, national
and racial friction obstruct, and successfully obstruct, the
broader views and more generous impulses which would make
every man the servant of all mankind.  The idea of human
brotherhood struggles now to possess the human soul, just as
the idea of Christendom struggled to possess the soul of
Europe in the confusion and disorder of the sixth and seventh
centuries of the Christian era.  The dissemination and
triumph of such ideas must be the work of a multitude of
devoted and undistinguished missionaries, and no contemporary
writer can presume to guess how far such work has gone or
what harvest it may be preparing.
</p>

<p>
Social and economic questions seem to be inseparably mingled
with international ones.  The solution in each case lies in
an appeal to that same spirit of service which can enter and
inspire the human heart.  The distrust, intractability and
egotism of nations reflects and is reflected by the distrust,
intractability and egotism of the individual owner and worker
in the face of the common good.  Exaggerations of
possessiveness in the individual are parallel and of a piece
with the clutching greed of nations and emperors.  They are
products of the same instinctive tendencies, and the same
ignorances and traditions.  Internationalism is the socialism
of nations.  No one who has wrestled with these problems can
feel that there yet exists a sufficient depth and strength of
psychological science and a sufficiently planned-out
educational method and organization for any real and final
solution of these riddles of human intercourse and
cooperation.  We are as incapable of planning a really
effective peace organization of the world to-day as were men
in 1820 to plan an <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P381"></a>381}</span>electric railway system, but for
all we know the thing is equally practicable and may be as
nearly at hand.
</p>

<p>
No man can go beyond his own knowledge, no thought can reach
beyond contemporary thought, and it is impossible for us to
guess or foretell how many generations of humanity may have
to live in war and waste and insecurity and misery before the
dawn of the great peace to which all history seems to be
pointing, peace in the heart and peace in the world, ends our
night of wasteful and aimless living.  Our proposed solutions
are still vague and crude.  Passion and suspicion surround
them.  A great task of intellectual reconstruction is going
on, it is still incomplete, and our conceptions grow clearer
and more exact&#8212;slowly, rapidly, it is hard to tell
which.  But as they grow clearer they will gather power over
the minds and imaginations of men.  Their present lack of
grip is due to their lack of assurance and exact rightness.
  They are misunderstood because they are variously and
confusingly presented.  But with precision and certainty the
new vision of the world will gain compelling power.  It may
presently gain power very rapidly.  And a great work of
educational reconstruction will follow logically and
necessarily upon that clearer understanding.

<h4 align="center">THE EXPANSION OF THE UNITED STATES</h4>

<p>

THE region of the world that displayed the most immediate and
striking results from the new inventions in transport was
North America.  Politically the United States embodied, and
its constitution crystallized, the liberal ideas of the
middle eighteenth century.  It dispensed with state-church or
crown, it would have no titles, it protected property very
jealously as a method of freedom, and&#8212;the exact
practice varied at first in the different states&#8212;it
gave nearly every adult male citizen a vote.  Its method of
voting was barbarically crude, and as a consequence its
political life fell very soon under the control of highly
organized party machines, but that did not prevent the newly
emancipated population developing an energy, enterprise and
public spirit far beyond that of any other contemporary
population.
</p>

<p>
Then came that acceleration of locomotion to which we have
already called attention.  It is a curious thing that
America, which owes most to this acceleration in locomotion,
has felt it least.  The United States have taken the railway,
the river steamboat, the telegraph and so forth as though
they were a natural part of their growth.  They were not.
  These things happened to come along just in time to save
American unity.  The United States of to-day were made first
by the river steamboat, and then by the railway.  Without
these things, the present United States, this vast
continental nation, would have been altogether impossible.
  The westward flow of population would have been far more
sluggish.  It might never have crossed the great central
plains.  It took nearly two hundred years for effective
settlement to reach from the coast to Missouri, much less
than halfway across the continent.  The first state
established beyond the river was the steamboat state of
Missouri in 1821.  But the rest of the distance to the
Pacific was done in a few decades.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P383"></a>383}</span>If we
had the resources of the cinema it would be interesting to
show a map of North America year by year from 1600 onward,
with little dots to represent hundreds of people, each dot a
hundred, and stars to represent cities of a hundred thousand
people.
</p>

<p>
For two hundred years the reader would see that stippling
creeping slowly along the coastal districts and navigable
waters, spreading still more gradually into Indiana, Kentucky
and so forth.  Then somewhere about 1810 would come a change.
  Things would get more lively along the river courses.  The
dots would be multiplying and spreading.  That would be the
steamboat.  The pioneer dots would be spreading soon over
Kansas and Nebraska from a number of jumping-off places along
the great rivers.
</p>

<p>
Then from about 1850 onward would come the black lines of the
railways, and after that the little black dots would not
simply creep but run.  They would appear now so rapidly, it
would be almost as though they were being put on by some sort
of spraying machine.  And suddenly here and then there would
appear the first stars to indicate the first great cities of
a hundred thousand people.  First one or two and then a
multitude of cities&#8212;each like a knot in the growing net
of the railways.
</p>

<p>
The growth of the United States is a process that has no
precedent in the world&rsquo;s history; it is a new kind of
occurrence.  Such a community could not have come into
existence before, and if it had, without railways it would
certainly have dropped to pieces long before now.  Without
railways or telegraph it would be far easier to administer
California from Pekin than from Washington.  But this great
population of the United States of America has not only grown
outrageously; it has kept uniform.  Nay, it has become more
uniform.  The man of San Francisco is more like the man of
New York to-day than the man of Virginia was like the man of
New England a century ago.  And the process of assimilation
goes on unimpeded.  The United States is being woven by
railway, by telegraph, more and more into one vast unity,
speaking, thinking and acting harmoniously with itself.  Soon
aviation will be helping in the work.
</p>

<p>
This great community of the United States is an altogether
new thing in history.  There have been great empires before
with populations exceeding 100 millions, but these were
associations of divergent <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P384"></a>384}</span>peoples; there has never been one
single people on this scale before.  We want a new term for
this new thing.  We call the United States a country just as
we call France or Holland a country.  But the two things are
as different as an automobile and a one-horse shay.  They are
the creations of different periods and different conditions;
they are going to work at a different pace and in an entirely
different way.  The United States in scale and possibility is
halfway between a European state and a United States of all
the world.
</p>

<p>
But on the way to this present greatness and security the
American people passed through one phase of dire conflict.
  The river steamboats, the railways, the telegraph, and their
associate facilities, did not come soon enough to avert a
deepening conflict of interests and ideas between the
southern and northern states of the Union.  The former were
slave-holding states; the latter, states in which all men
were free.  The railways and steamboats at first did but
bring into sharper conflict an already established difference
between the two sections of the United States.  The
increasing unification due to the new means of transport made
the question whether the southern spirit or the northern
should prevail an ever more urgent one.  There was little
possibility of compromise.  The northern spirit was free and
individualistic; the southern made for great estates and a
conscious gentility ruling over a dusky subject multitude.
</p>

<p>
Every new territory that was organized into a state as the
tide of population swept westward, every new incorporation
into the fast growing American system, became a field of
conflict between the two ideas, whether it should become a
state of free citizens, or whether the estate and slavery
system should prevail.  From 1833 an American anti-slavery
society was not merely resisting the extension of the
institution but agitating the whole country for its complete
abolition.  The issue flamed up into open conflict over the
admission of Texas to the Union.  Texas had originally been a
part of the republic of Mexico, but it was largely colonized
by Americans from the slave-holding states, and it seceded
from Mexico, established its independence in 1835, and was
annexed to the United States in 1844.  Under the Mexican law
slavery had been forbidden in Texas, but now the South
claimed Texas for slavery and got it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P385"></a>385}</span>Meanwhile the development of ocean
navigation was bringing a growing swarm of immigrants from
Europe to swell the spreading population of the northern
states, and the raising of Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and
Oregon, all northern farm lands, to state level, gave the
anti-slavery North the possibility of predominance both in
the Senate and the House of Representatives.  The cotton-
growing South, irritated by the growing threat of the
Abolitionist movement, and fearing this predominance in
Congress, began to talk of secession from the Union.
  Southerners began to dream of annexations to the south of
them in Mexico and the West Indies, and of great slave state,
detached from the North and reaching to Panama.
</p>

<p>
The return of Abraham Lincoln as an anti-extension President
in 1860 decided the South to split the Union.  South Carolina
passed an &ldquo;ordinance of secession&rdquo; and prepared
for war.  Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana
and Texas joined her, and a convention met at Montgomery in
Alabama, elected Jefferson Davis president of the
&ldquo;Confederated States&rdquo; of America, and adopted a
constitution specifically upholding &ldquo;the institution of
negro slavery.&rdquo;

<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P386"></a>386}</span>Abraham
Lincoln was, it chanced, a man entirely typical of the new
people that had grown up after the War of Independence.  His
early years had been spent as a drifting particle in the
general westward flow of the population.  He was born in
Kentucky (1809), was taken to Indiana as a boy and later on
to Illinois.  Life was rough in the backwoods of Indiana in
those days; the house was a mere log cabin in the wilderness,
and his schooling was poor and casual.  But his mother taught
him to read early, and he became a voracious reader.  At
seventeen he was a big athletic youth, a great wrestler and
runner.  He worked for a time as clerk in a store, went into
business as a storekeeper with a drunken partner, and
contracted debts that he did not fully pay off for fifteen
years.  In 1834, when he was still only five and twenty, he
was elected member of the House of Representatives for the
State of Illinois.  In Illinois particularly the question of
slavery flamed because the great leader of the party for the
extension of slavery in the national Congress was Senator
Douglas of Illinois.  Douglas was a man of great ability and
prestige, and for some years Lincoln fought against him by
speech and pamphlet, rising steadily to the position of his
most formidable and finally victorious antagonist.  Their
culminating struggle was the presidential campaign of 1860,
and on the fourth of March, 1861, Lincoln was inaugurated
President, with the southern states already in active
secession from the rule of the federal government at
Washington, and committing acts of war.
</p>

<p>
This civil war in America was fought by improvised armies
that grew steadily from a few score thousands to hundreds of
thousands&#8212;until at last the Federal forces exceeded a
million men; it was fought over a vast area between New
Mexico and the eastern sea, Washington and Richmond were the
chief objectives.  It is beyond our scope here to tell of the
mounting energy of that epic struggle that rolled to and fro
across the hills and woods of Tennessee and Virginia and down
the Mississippi.  There was a terrible waste and killing of
men.  Thrust was followed by counter thrust; hope gave way to
despondency, and returned and was again disappointed.
  Sometimes Washington seemed within the Confederate grasp;
again the Federal armies were driving towards Richmond.  The
Confederates, outnumbered and far poorer in resources, fought
under <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P387"></a>387}</span>a
general of supreme ability, General Lee.  The generalship of
the Union was far inferior.  Generals were dismissed, new
generals appointed; until at last, under Sherman and Grant,
came victory over the ragged and depleted South.  In October,
1864, a Federal army under Sherman broke through the
Confederate left and marched down from Tennessee through
Georgia to the coast, right across the Confederate country,
and then turned up through the <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P388"></a>388}</span>Carolinas, coming in upon the rear
of the Confederate armies.  Meanwhile Grant held Lee before
Richmond until Sherman closed on him.  On April 9th, 1865,
Lee and his army surrendered at Appomattox Court House, and
within a month all the remaining secessionist armies had laid
down their arms and the Confederacy was at an end.

</h4>
</center>

<p>
This four years&rsquo; struggle had meant an enormous
physical and moral strain for the people of the United
States.  The principle of state autonomy was very dear to
many minds, and the North seemed in effect to be forcing
abolition upon the South.  In the border states brothers and
cousins, even fathers and sons, would take opposite sides and
find themselves in antagonistic armies.  The North felt its
cause a righteous one, but for great numbers of people it was
not a full-bodied and unchallenged righteousness.  But for
Lincoln there was no doubt.  He was a clear-minded man in the
midst of much confusion.  He stood for union; he stood for
the wide peace of America.  He was opposed to slavery, but
slavery he held to be a secondary issue; his primary purpose
was that the United States should not be torn into two
contrasted and jarring fragments.
</p>

<p>
When in the opening stages of the war Congress and the
Federal generals embarked upon a precipitate emancipation,
Lincoln opposed and mitigated their enthusiasm.  He was for
emancipation by stages and with compensation.  It was only in
January, 1865, that the situation had ripened to a point when
Congress could propose to abolish slavery for ever by a
constitutional amendment, and the war was already over before
this amendment was ratified by the states.
</p>

<p>
As the war dragged on through 1862 and 1863, the first
passions and enthusiasms waned, and America learnt all the
phases of war weariness and war disgust.  The President found
himself with defeatists, traitors, dismissed generals,
tortuous party politicians, and a doubting and fatigued
people behind him and uninspired generals and depressed
troops before him; his chief consolation must have been that
Jefferson Davis at Richmond could be in little better case.
  The English government misbehaved, and permitted the
Confederate agents in England to launch and man three swift
privateer ships&#8212;the <i>Alabama</i> is the best
remembered of them&#8212;which <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P389"></a>389}</span>chased United States shipping from
the seas.  The French army in Mexico was trampling the Monroe
Doctrine in the dirt.  Came subtle proposals from Richmond to
drop the war, leave the issues of the war for subsequent
discussion, and turn, Federal and Confederate in alliance,
upon the French in Mexico.  But Lincoln would not listen to
such proposals unless the supremacy of the Union was
maintained.  The Americans might do such things as one people
but not as two.
</p>

<p>
He held the United States together through long weary months
of reverses and ineffective effort, through black phases of
division and failing courage; and there is no record that he
ever faltered from his purpose.  There were times when there
was nothing to be done, when he sat in the White House silent
and motionless, a grim monument of resolve; times when he
relaxed his mind by jesting and broad anecdotes.
</p>

<p>
He saw the Union triumphant.  He entered Richmond the day
after its surrender, and heard of Lee&rsquo;s capitulation.
  He returned to Washington, and on April 11th made his last
public address.  His theme was reconciliation and the
reconstruction of loyal government in the defeated states.
  On the evening of April 14th he went to Ford&rsquo;s theatre
in Washington, and as he sat looking at the stage, he was
shot in the back of the head and killed by an actor named
Booth who had some sort of grievance against him, and who had
crept into the box unobserved.  But Lincoln&rsquo;s work was
done; the Union was saved.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the war there was no railway to the
Pacific coast; after it the railways spread like a swiftly
growing plant until now they have clutched and held and woven
all the vast territory of the United States into one
indissoluble mental and material unity&#8212;the greatest
real community&#8212;until the common folk of China have
learnt to read&#8212;in the world.

<h4 align="center">THE RISE OF GERMANY TO PREDOMINANCE IN
EUROPE</h4>

<p>

WE have told how after the convulsion of the French
Revolution and the Napoleonic adventure, Europe settled down
again for a time to an insecure peace and a sort of
modernized revival of the political conditions of fifty years
before.  Until the middle of the century the new facilities
in the handling of steel and the railway and steamship
produced no marked political consequences.  But the social
tension due to the development of urban industrialism grew.
  France remained a conspicuously uneasy country.  The
revolution of 1830 was followed by another in 1848.  Then
Napoleon III, a nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, became first
President, and then (in 1852) Emperor.
</p>

<p>
He set about rebuilding Paris, and changed it from a
picturesque seventeenth century insanitary city into the
spacious Latinized city of marble it is to-day.  He set about
rebuilding France, and made it into a brilliant-looking
modernized imperialism.  He displayed a disposition to revive
that competitiveness of the Great Powers which had kept
Europe busy with futile wars during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries.  The Tsar Nicholas I of Russia (1825-
1856) was also becoming aggressive and pressing southward
upon the Turkish Empire with his eyes on Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
After the turn of the century Europe broke out into a fresh
cycle of wars.  They were chiefly &ldquo;balance-of-
power&rdquo; and ascendancy wars.  England, France and
Sardinia assailed Russia in the Crimean war in defence of
Turkey; Prussia (with Italy as an ally) and Austria fought
for the leadership of Germany, France liberated North Italy
from Austria at the price of Savoy, and Italy gradually
unified itself into one kingdom.  Then Napoleon III was so
ill advised as to attempt adventures in Mexico, during the
American Civil War; he set up an Emperor Maximilian there and
abandoned him hastily to <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P391"></a>391}</span>his fate&#8212;he was shot by the
Mexicans&#8212;when the victorious Federal Government showed
its teeth.

</center>

<p>
In 1870 came a long-pending struggle for predominance in
Europe between France and Prussia.  Prussia had long foreseen
and prepared for this struggle, and France was rotten with
financial corruption.  Her defeat was swift and dramatic.
  The Germans invaded France in August, one great French army
under the Emperor capitulated at Sedan in September, another
surrendered in October at Metz, and in January 1871, Paris,
after a siege and bombardment, fell into German hands.  Peace
was signed at Frankfort surrendering the provinces of Alsace
and Lorraine to the Germans.  <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P392"></a>392}</span>Germany, excluding Austria, was
unified as an empire, and the King of Prussia was added to
the galaxy of European C&#230;sars, as the German Emperor.
</p>

<p>
For the next forty-three years Germany was the leading power
upon the European continent.  There was a Russo-Turkish war
in 1877-8, but thereafter, except for certain readjustments
in the Balkans, European frontiers remained uneasily stable
for thirty years.

<h4 align="center">THE NEW OVERSEAS EMPIRES OF STEAMSHIP AND
RAILWAY</h4>

<p>

THE end of the eighteenth century was a period of disrupting
empires and disillusioned expansionists.  The long and
tedious journey between Britain and Spain and their colonies
in America prevented any really free coming and going between
the home land and the daughter lands, and so the colonies
separated into new and distinct communities, with distinctive
ideas and interests and even modes of speech.  As they grew
they strained more and more at the feeble and uncertain link
of shipping that had joined them.  Weak trading-posts in the
wilderness, like those of France in Canada, or trading
establishments in great alien communities, like those of
Britain in India, might well cling for bare existence to the
nation which gave them support and a reason for their
existence.  That much and no more seemed to many thinkers in
the early part of the nineteenth century to be the limit set
to overseas rule.  In 1820 the sketchy great European
&ldquo;empires&rdquo; outside of Europe that had figured so
bravely in the maps of the middle eighteenth century, had
shrunken to very small dimensions.  Only the Russian sprawled
as large as ever across Asia.
</p>

<p>
The British Empire in 1815 consisted of the thinly populated
coastal river and lake regions of Canada, and a great
hinterland of wilderness in which the only settlements as yet
were the fur-trading stations of the Hudson Bay Company,
about a third of the Indian peninsula, under the rule of the
East India Company, the coast districts of the Cape of Good
Hope inhabited by blacks and rebellious-spirited Dutch
settlers; a few trading stations on the coast of West Africa,
the rock of Gibraltar, the island of Malta, Jamaica, a few
minor slave-labour possessions in the West Indies, British
Guiana in South America, and, on the other side of the world,
two dumps for convicts at Botany Bay in Australia and in
Tasmania.  Spain retained Cuba and a few settlements in the
Philippine Islands.  <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P394"></a>394}</span>Portugal had in Africa some
vestiges of her ancient claims.  Holland had various islands
and possessions in the East Indies and Dutch Guiana, and
Denmark an island or so in the West Indies.  France had one
or two West Indian islands and French Guiana.  This seemed to
be as much as the European powers needed, or were likely to
acquire of the rest of the world.  Only the East India
Company showed any spirit of expansion.
</p>

<p>
While Europe was busy with the Napoleonic wars the East India
Company, under a succession of Governors-General, was playing
much the same role in India that had been played before by
Turkoman and such-like invaders from the north.  And after
the peace of Vienna it went on, levying its revenues, making
wars, sending ambassadors to Asiatic powers, a quasi-
independent state, however, with a marked disposition to send
wealth westward.
</p>

<p>
We cannot tell here in any detail how the British Company
made its way to supremacy sometimes as the ally of this
power, sometimes as that, and finally as the conqueror of
all.  Its power spread to Assam, Sind, Oudh.  The map of
India began to take on the outlines familiar to the English
schoolboy of to-day, a patchwork of native states embraced
and held together by the great provinces under direct British
rule. . . .
</p>

<p>
In 1859, following upon a serious mutiny of the native troops
in India, this empire of the East India Company was annexed
to the British Crown.  By an Act entitled <i>An Act for the
Better Government of India</i>, the Governor-General became a
Viceroy representing the Sovereign, and the place of the
Company was taken by a Secretary of State for India
responsible to the British Parliament.  In 1877, Lord
Beaconsfield, to complete the work, caused Queen Victoria to
be proclaimed Empress of India.
</p>

<p>
Upon these extraordinary lines India and Britain are linked
at the present time.  India is still the empire of the Great
Mogul, but the Great Mogul has been replaced by the
&ldquo;crowned republic&rdquo; of Great Britain.  India is an
autocracy without an autocrat.  Its rule combines the
disadvantage of absolute monarchy with the impersonality and
irresponsibility of democratic officialdom.  The Indian with
a complaint to make has no visible monarch to go to; his
Emperor is a golden symbol; he must circulate pamphlets in
England <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P395"></a>395}</span>or inspire a question in the
British House of Commons.  The more occupied Parliament is
with British affairs, the less attention India will receive,
and the more she will be at the mercy of her small group of
higher officials.

<p>
Apart from India, there was no great expansion of any
European Empire until the railways and the steamships were in
effective action.  A considerable school of political
thinkers in Britain was disposed to regard overseas
possessions as a source of weakness to the kingdom.  The
Australian settlements developed slowly until in 1842 the
discovery of valuable copper mines, and in 1851 of gold, gave
them a new importance.  Improvements in transport were also
making Australian wool an increasingly marketable commodity
in Europe.  <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P396"></a>396}</span>Canada, too, was not remarkably
progressive until 1849; it was troubled by dissensions
between its French and British inhabitants, there were
several serious revolts, and it was only in 1867 that a new
constitution creating a Federal Dominion of Canada relieved
its internal strains.  It was the railway that altered the
Canadian outlook.  It enabled Canada, just as it enabled the
United States, to expand westward, to market its corn and
other produce in Europe, and in spite of its swift and
extensive growth, to remain in language and sympathy and
interests one community.  The railway, the steamship and the
telegraph cable were indeed changing all the conditions of
colonial development.
</p>

<p>
Before 1840, English settlements had already begun in New
Zealand, and a New Zealand Land Company had been formed to
exploit the possibilities of the island.  In 1840 New Zealand
also was added to the colonial possessions of the British
Crown.
</p>

<p>
Canada, as we have noted, was the first of the British
possessions to respond richly to the new economic
possibilities that the new methods of transport were opening.
  Presently the republics of South America, and particularly
the Argentine Republic, began to feel in their cattle trade
and coffee growing the increased nearness of the European
market.  Hitherto the chief commodities that had attracted
the European powers into unsettled and barbaric regions had
been gold or other metals, spices, ivory, or slaves.  But in
the latter quarter of the nineteenth century the increase of
the European populations was obliging their governments to
look abroad for staple foods; and the growth of scientific
industrialism was creating a demand for new raw materials,
fats and greases of every kind, rubber, and other hitherto
disregarded substances.  It was plain that Great Britain and
Holland and Portugal were reaping a great and growing
commercial advantage from their very considerable control of
tropical and sub-tropical products.  After 1871 Germany, and
presently France and later Italy, began to look for unannexed
raw-material areas, or for Oriental countries capable of
profitable modernization.
</p>

<p>
So began a fresh scramble all over the world, except in the
American region where the Monroe Doctrine now barred such
adventures, for politically unprotected lands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P397"></a>397}</span>Close to
Europe was the continent of Africa, full of vaguely known
possibilities.  In 1850 it was a continent of black mystery;
only Egypt and the coast were known.  Here we have no space
to tell the amazing story of the explorers and adventurers
who first pierced the African darkness, and of the political
agents, administrators, traders, settlers and scientific men
who followed in their track.  Wonderful races of men like the
pygmies, strange beasts like the okapi, marvellous fruits and
flowers and insects, terrible diseases, astounding scenery of
forest and mountain, enormous inland seas and gigantic rivers
and cascades were revealed; a whole new world.  Even remains
(at Zimbabwe) of some unrecorded and vanished civilization,
the southward enterprise of an early people, were discovered.
  Into this new world came the Europeans, and found the rifle
already there in the hands of the Arab slave-traders, and
negro life in disorder.
</p>

<a name="img-397"></a>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-397.jpg"
alt="Map: The British Empire in 1815"
 width="600" border="2" height="328">
</center>

<p>
By 1900, in half a century, all Africa was mapped, explored,
estimated and divided between the European powers.  Little
heed was given to the welfare of the natives in this
scramble.  The Arab slaver was indeed curbed rather than
expelled, but the greed for rubber, which was a wild product
collected under compulsion by the natives in the Belgian
Congo, a greed exacerbated by the clash of inexperienced
European administrators with the native <span
class="pagenum">{<a name="P398"></a>398}</span>population,
led to horrible atrocities.  No European power has perfectly
clean hands in this matter.
</p>

<p>
We cannot tell here in any detail how Great Britain got
possession of Egypt in 1883 and remained there in spite of
the fact that Egypt was technically a part of the Turkish
Empire, nor how nearly this scramble led to war between
France and Great Britain in 1898, when a certain Colonel
Marchand, crossing Central Africa from the west coast, tried
at Fashoda to seize the Upper Nile.
</p>

<p>
Nor can we tell how the British Government first let the
Boers, or Dutch settlers, of the Orange River district and
the Transvaal set up independent republics in the inland
parts of South Africa, and then repented and annexed the
Transvaal Republic in 1877; nor how the Transvaal Boers
fought for freedom and won it after the battle of Majuba Hill
(1881).  Majuba Hill was made to rankle in the memory of the
English people by a persistent press campaign.  A war with
both republics broke out in 1899, a three years&rsquo; war
enormously costly to the British people, which ended at last
in the surrender of the two republics.
</p>

<p>
Their period of subjugation was a brief one.  In 1907, after
the downfall of the imperialist government which had
conquered them, the Liberals took the South African problem
in hand, and these former republics became free and fairly
willing associates with Cape Colony and  Natal in a
Confederation of all the states of South Africa as one self-
governing republic under the British Crown.
</p>

<p>
In a quarter of a century the partition of Africa was
completed.  There remained unannexed three comparatively
small countries: Liberia, a settlement of liberated negro
slaves on the west coast; Morocco, under a Moslem Sultan; and
Abyssinia, a barbaric country, with an ancient and peculiar
form of Christianity, which had successfully maintained its
independence against Italy at the battle of Adowa in 1896.

<h4 align="center">EUROPEAN AGGRESSION IN ASIA AND THE RISE
OF JAPAN</h4>

<p>

IT is difficult to believe that any large number of people
really accepted this headlong painting of the map of Africa
in European colours as a permanent new settlement of the
worlds affairs, but it is the duty of the historian to record
that it was so accepted.  There was but a shallow historical
background to the European mind in the nineteenth century,
and no habit of penetrating criticism.  The quite temporary
advantages that the mechanical revolution in the west had
given the Europeans over the rest of the old world were
regarded by people, blankly ignorant of such events as the
great Mongol conquests, as evidences of a permanent and
assured European leadership of mankind.  They had no sense of
the transferability of science and its fruits.  They did not
realize that Chinamen and Indians could carry on the work of
research as ably as Frenchmen or Englishmen.  They believed
that there was some innate intellectual drive in the west,
and some innate indolence and conservatism in the east, that
assured the Europeans a world predominance for ever.
</p>

<p>
The consequence of this infatuation was that the various
European foreign offices set themselves not merely to
scramble with the British for the savage and undeveloped
regions of the world&rsquo;s surface, but also to carve up
the populous and civilized countries of Asia as though these
people also were no more than raw material for exploitation.
  The inwardly precarious but outwardly splendid imperialism of
the British ruling class in India, and the extensive and
profitable possessions of the Dutch in the East Indies,
filled the rival Great Powers with dreams of similar glories
in Persia, in the disintegrating Ottoman Empire, and in
Further India, China and Japan.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P400"></a>400}</span>In 1898
Germany seized Kiau Chau in China.  Britain responded by
seizing Wei-hai-wei, and the next year the Russians took
possession of Port Arthur.  A flame of hatred for the
Europeans swept through China.  There were massacres of
Europeans and Christian converts, and in 1900 an attack upon
and siege of the European legations in Pekin.  A combined
force of Europeans made a punitive expedition to Pekin,
rescued the legations, and stole an enormous amount of
valuable property.  The Russians then seized Manchuria, and
in 1904, the British invaded Tibet....
</p>

<p>
But now a new Power appeared in the struggle of the Great
Powers, Japan.  Hitherto Japan has played but a small part in
this history; her secluded civilization has not contributed
very largely to the general shaping of human destinies; she
has received much, but she has given little.  The Japanese
proper are of the Mongolian race.  Their civilization, their
writing and their literary and artistic traditions are
derived from the Chinese.  Their history is an interesting
and romantic one; they developed a feudal system and a system
of chivalry in the earlier centuries of the Christian era;
their attacks upon Korea and China are an Eastern equivalent
of the English wars in France.  Japan was first brought into
contact with Europe in the sixteenth century; in 1542 some
Portuguese reached it in a Chinese junk, and in 1549 a Jesuit
missionary, Francis Xavier, began his teaching there.  For a
time Japan welcomed European intercourse, and the Christian
missionaries made a great number of converts.  A certain
William Adams became the most trusted European adviser of the
Japanese, and showed them how to build big ships.  There were
voyages in Japanese-built ships to India and Peru.  Then
arose complicated quarrels between the Spanish Dominicans,
the Portuguese Jesuits, and the English and Dutch
Protestants, each warning the Japanese against the political
designs of the others.  The Jesuits, in a phase of
ascendancy, persecuted and insulted the Buddhists with great
acrimony.  In the end the Japanese came to the conclusion
that the Europeans were an intolerable nuisance, and that
Catholic Christianity in particular was a mere cloak for the
political dreams of the Pope and the Spanish
monarchy&#8212;already in possession of the Philippine
Islands; there was a great persecution of the Christians, and
in 1638 Japan was absolutely <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P401"></a>401}</span>closed to Europeans, and remained
closed for over 200 years.  During those two centuries the
Japanese were as completely cut off from the rest of the
world as though they lived upon another planet.  It was
forbidden to build any ship larger than a mere coasting boat.
  No Japanese could go abroad, and no European enter the
country.

JAPANESE SOLDIER ON THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY

<p>
For two centuries Japan remained outside the main current of
history.  She lived on in a state of picturesque feudalism in
which about five per cent of the population, the
<i>samurai</i>, or fighting men, and the nobles and their
families, tyrannized without restraint over the rest of the
population.  Meanwhile the great world outside went on to
wider visions and new powers.  Strange shipping became more
frequent, passing the Japanese headlands; sometimes ships
were wrecked and sailors brought ashore.  Through the Dutch
settlement in the island of Deshima, their one link with the
outer universe, came warnings that Japan was not keeping pace
with the power of the Western world.  In 1837 a ship sailed
into Yedo Bay flying a strange flag of stripes and stars, and
carrying some Japanese sailors she had picked up far adrift
in the Pacific.  She was driven off by cannon shot.  This
flag presently reappeared on other ships.  One in 1849 came
to demand the liberation <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P402"></a>402}</span>of eighteen shipwrecked American
sailors.  Then in 1853 came four American warships under
Commodore Perry, and refused to be driven away.  He lay at
anchor in forbidden waters, and sent messages to the two
rulers who at that time shared the control of Japan.  In 1854
he returned with ten ships, amazing ships propelled by steam,
and equipped with big guns, and he made proposals for trade
and intercourse that the Japanese had no power to resist.  He
landed with a guard of 500 men to sign the treaty.
  Incredulous crowds watched this visitation from the outer
world, marching through the streets.
</p>

<p>
Russia, Holland and Britain followed in the wake of America.
  A great nobleman whose estates commanded the Straits of
Shimonoseki saw fit to fire on foreign vessels, and a
bombardment by a fleet of British, French, Dutch and American
warships destroyed his batteries and scattered his swordsmen.
  Finally an allied squadron (1865), at anchor off Kioto,
imposed a ratification of the treaties which opened Japan to
the world.
</p>

<p>
The humiliation of the Japanese by these events was intense.
  With astonishing energy and intelligence they set themselves
to bring their culture and organization to the level of the
European Powers.  Never in all the history of mankind did a
nation make such a stride as Japan then did.  In 1866 she was
a medieval people, a fantastic caricature of the extremest
romantic feudalism; in 1899 hers was a completely Westernized
people, on a level with the most advanced European Powers.
  She completely dispelled the persuasion that Asia was in some
irrevocable way hopelessly behind Europe.  She made all
European progress seem sluggish by comparison.
</p>

<p>
We cannot tell here in any detail of Japan&rsquo;s war with
China in 1894-95.  It demonstrated the extent of her
Westernization.  She had an efficient Westernized army and a
small but sound fleet.  But the significance of her
renascence, though it was appreciated by Britain and the
United States, who were already treating her as if she were a
European state, was not understood by the other Great Powers
engaged in the pursuit of new Indias in Asia.  Russia was
pushing down through Manchuria to Korea.  France was already
established far to the south in Tonkin and Annam, Germany was
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P403"></a>403}</span>prowling
hungrily on the look-out for some settlement.  The three
Powers combined to prevent Japan reaping any fruits from the
Chinese war.  She was exhausted by the struggle, and they
threatened her with war.

<p>
Japan submitted for a time and gathered her forces.  Within
ten years she was ready for a struggle with Russia, which
marks an epoch in the history of Asia, the close of the
period of European arrogance.  The Russian people were, of
course, innocent and ignorant of this trouble that was being
made for them halfway round the world, and the wiser Russian
statesmen were against these foolish thrusts; but a gang of
financial adventurers, including the Grand Dukes, his
cousins, surrounded the Tsar.  They had gambled deeply in the
prospective looting of Manchuria and China, and they would
suffer no withdrawal.  So there began a transportation of
great armies of Japanese soldiers across the sea to Port
Arthur and Korea, and the sending of endless trainloads of
Russian peasants along the Siberian railway to die in those
distant battlefields.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P404"></a>404}</span>The
Russians, badly led and dishonestly provided, were beaten on
sea and land alike.  The Russian Baltic Fleet sailed round
Africa to be utterly destroyed in the Straits of Tshushima.
  A revolutionary movement among the common people of Russia,
infuriated by this remote and reasonless slaughter, obliged
the Tsar to end the war (1905); he returned the southern half
of Saghalien, which had been seized by Russia in 1875,
evacuated Manchuria, resigned Korea to Japan.  The European
invasion of Asia was coming to an end and the retraction of
Europe&rsquo;s tentacles was beginning.

First and central to the whole system was the &ldquo;crowned
republic&rdquo; of the United British Kingdom, including
(against the will of a considerable part of the Irish people)
Ireland.  The majority of the British Parliament, made up of
the three united parliaments of England and Wales, Scotland
and Ireland, determines the headship, the quality and policy
of the ministry, and determines it largely on considerations
arising out of British domestic politics.  It is this
ministry which is the effective supreme government, with
powers of peace and war, over all the rest of the empire.
</p>

<p>
Next in order of political importance to the British States
were the &ldquo;crowned republics&rdquo; of Australia,
Canada, Newfoundland (the oldest British possession, 1583),
New Zealand and South Africa, all practically independent and
self-governing states in alliance with Great Britain, but
each with a representative of the Crown appointed by the
Government in office;
</p>

<p>
Next the Indian Empire, an extension of the Empire of the
Great Mogul with its dependent and &ldquo;protected&rdquo;
states reaching now from Beluchistan to Burma, and including
Aden, in all of which empire the British Crown and the India
Office (under Parliamentary control) played the role of the
original Turkoman dynasty;
</p>

<p>
Then the ambiguous possession of Egypt, still nominally a
part of the Turkish Empire and still retaining its own
monarch, the Khedive, but under almost despotic British
official rule;

<p>
Then the still more ambiguous &ldquo;Anglo-Egyptian&rdquo;
Sudan <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P407"></a>407}</span>province, occupied and
administered jointly by the British and by the (British
controlled) Egyptian Government;
</p>

<p>
Then a number of partially self-governing communities, some
British in origin and some not, with elected legislatures and
an appointed executive, such as Malta, Jamaica, the Bahamas
and Bermuda;
</p>

<p>
Then the Crown colonies, in which the rule of the British
Home Government (through the Colonial Office) verged on
autocracy, as in Ceylon, Trinidad and Fiji (where there was
an appointed council), and Gibraltar and St. Helena (where
there was a governor);

<p>
Then great areas of (chiefly) tropical lands, raw-product
areas, with politically weak and under-civilized native
communities which were nominally protectorates, and
administered either by a High Commissioner set over native
chiefs (as in Basutoland) or over a chartered company (as in
Rhodesia).  In some cases the Foreign Office, in some cases
the Colonial Office, and in some cases the India Office, has
been concerned in acquiring the possessions that fell into
this last and least definite class of all, but for the most
part the Colonial Office was now responsible for them.
</p>

<p>
It will be manifest, therefore, that no single office and no
single brain had ever comprehended the British Empire as a
whole.  It was a mixture of growths and accumulations
entirely different from anything that has ever been called an
empire before.  It guaranteed a wide peace and security; that
is why it was endured and sustained by many men of the
&ldquo;subject&rdquo; races&#8212;in spite of official
tyrannies <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P408"></a>408}</span>and insufficiencies, and of much
negligence on the part of the &ldquo;home&rdquo; public.
  Like the Athenian Empire, it was an overseas empire; its ways
were sea ways, and its common link was the British Navy.
  Like all empires, its cohesion was dependent physically upon
a method of communication; the development of seamanship,
ship-building and steamships between the sixteenth and
nineteenth centuries had made it a possible and convenient
Pax&#8212;the &ldquo;Pax Britannica,&rdquo; and fresh
developments of air or swift land transport might at any time
make it inconvenient.

<h4 align="center">THE AGE OF ARMAMENT IN EUROPE, AND THE
GREAT WAR OF 1914-18</h4>

<p>

THE progress in material science that created this vast
steamboat-and-railway republic of America and spread this
precarious British steamship empire over the world, produced
quite other effects upon the congested nations upon the
continent of Europe.  They found themselves confined within
boundaries fixed during the horse-and-high-road period of
human life, and their expansion overseas had been very
largely anticipated by Great Britain.  Only Russia had any
freedom to expand eastward; and she drove a great railway
across Siberia until she entangled herself in a conflict with
Japan, and pushed south-eastwardly towards the borders of
Persia and India to the annoyance of Britain.  The rest of
the European Powers were in a state of intensifying
congestion.  In order to realize the full possibilities of
the new apparatus of human life they had to rearrange their
affairs upon a broader basis, either by some sort of
voluntary union or by a union imposed upon them by some
predominant power.  The tendency of modern thought was in the
direction of the former alternative, but all the force of
political tradition drove Europe towards the latter.
</p>

<p>
The downfall of the &ldquo;empire&rdquo; of Napoleon III, the
establishment of the new German Empire, pointed men&rsquo;s
hopes and fears towards the idea of a Europe consolidated
under German auspices.  For thirty-six years of uneasy peace
the polities of Europe centred upon that possibility.
  France, the steadfast rival of Germany for European
ascendancy since the division of the empire of Charlemagne,
sought to correct her own weakness by a close alliance with
Russia, and Germany linked herself closely with the Austrian
Empire (it had ceased to be the Holy Roman Empire in the days
of Napoleon I) and less successfully with the new kingdom of
Italy.  <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P410"></a>410}</span>At first Great Britain stood as
usual half in and half out of continental affairs.  But she
was gradually forced into a close association with the
Franco-Russian group by the aggressive development of a great
German navy.  The grandiose imagination of the Emperor
William II (1888-1918) thrust Germany into premature overseas
enterprise that ultimately brought not only Great Britain but
Japan and the United States into the circle of her enemies.

All these nations armed.  Year after year the proportion of
national production devoted to the making of guns, equipment,
battleships and the like, increased. Year after year the
balance <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P411"></a>411}</span>of things seemed trembling towards
war, and then war would be averted.  At last it came.
  Germany and Austria struck at France and Russia and Serbia;
the German armies marching through Belgium, Britain
immediately came into the war on the side of Belgium,
bringing in Japan as her ally, and very soon Turkey followed
on the German side.  Italy entered the war against Austria in
1915, and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the October
of that year.  In 1916 Rumania, and in 1917 the United States
and China were forced into war against Germany.  It is not
within the scope of this history to define the exact share of
blame for this vast catastrophe.  The more interesting
question is not why the Great War was begun but why the Great
War was not anticipated and prevented.  It is a far graver
thing for mankind that scores of millions of people were too
&ldquo;patriotic,&rdquo; stupid, or apathetic to prevent this
disaster by a movement towards European unity upon frank and
generous lines, than that a small number of people may have
been active in bringing it about.

</center>

<p>
It is impossible within the space at our command here to
trace the intricate details of the war.  Within a few months
it became apparent that the progress of modern technical
science had changed <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P412"></a>412}</span>the nature of warfare very
profoundly.  Physical science gives power, power over steel,
over distance, over disease; whether that power is used well
or ill depends upon the moral and political intelligence of
the world.  The governments of Europe, inspired by antiquated
policies of hate and suspicion, found themselves with
unexampled powers both of destruction and resistance in their
hands.  The war became a consuming fire round and about the
world, causing losses both to victors and vanquished out of
all proportion to the issues involved.  The first phase of
the war was a tremendous rush of the Germans upon Paris and
an invasion of East Prussia by the Russians.  Both attacks
were held and turned.  Then the power of the defensive
developed; there was a rapid elaboration of trench warfare
until for a time the opposing armies lay entrenched in long
lines right across Europe, unable to make any advance without
enormous losses.  The armies were millions strong, and behind
them entire populations were organized for the supply of food
and munitions to the front.  Then was a cessation of nearly
every sort of productive activity except such as contributed
to military operations.  All the able-bodied manhood of
Europe was drawn into the armies or navies or into the
improvised <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P413"></a>413}</span>factories that served them.  There
was an enormous replacement of men by women in industry.
  Probably more than half the people in the belligerent
countries of Europe changed their employment altogether
during this stupendous struggle.  They were socially uprooted
and transplanted.  Education and normal scientific work were
restricted or diverted to immediate military ends, and the
distribution of news was crippled and corrupted by military
control and &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; activities.
</p>

<p>
The phase of military deadlock passed slowly into one of
aggression upon the combatant populations behind the fronts
by the destruction of food supplies and by attacks through
the air.  And also there was a steady improvement in the size
and range of the guns employed and of such ingenious devices
as poison-gas shells and the small mobile forts known as
tanks, to break down the resistance of troops in the
trenches.  The air offensive was the most revolutionary of
all the new methods.  It carried warfare from two dimensions
into three.  Hitherto in the history of mankind war had gone
on only where the armies marched and met.  Now it went on
everywhere.  First the Zeppelin and then the bombing
aeroplane carried war over and past the front to an ever-
increasing area of civilian activities beyond.  The old
distinction maintained in civilized warfare between the
civilian and combatant population disappeared.  Everyone who
grew food, or who sewed a garment, everyone who felled a tree
or repaired a house, every railway station and every
warehouse was held to be fair game for destruction.  The air
offensive increased in range and terror with every month in
the war.  At last great areas of Europe were in a state of
siege and subject to nightly raids.  Such exposed cities as
London and Paris passed sleepless night after sleepless night
while the bombs burst, the anti-aircraft guns maintained an
intolerable racket, and the fire engines and ambulances
rattled headlong through the darkened and deserted streets.
  The effects upon the minds and health of old people and of
young children were particularly distressing and destructive.
</p>

<p>
Pestilence, that old follower of warfare, did not arrive
until the very end of the fighting in 1918.  For four years
medical science staved off any general epidemic; then came a
great outbreak of <span class="pagenum">{<a
name="P414"></a>414}</span>influenza about the world which
destroyed many millions of people.  Famine also was staved
off for some time.  By the beginning of 1918 however most of
Europe was in a state of mitigated and regulated famine.  The
production of food throughout the world had fallen very
greatly through the calling off of peasant mankind to the
fronts, and the distribution of such food as was produced was
impeded by the havoc wrought by the submarine, by the rupture
of customary routes through the closing of frontiers, and by
the disorganization of the transport system of the world.
  The various governments took possession of the dwindling food
supplies, and, with more or less success, rationed their
populations.  By the fourth year the whole world was
suffering from shortages of clothing and housing and of most
of the normal gear of life as well as of food.  Business and
economic life were profoundly disorganized.  Every-one was
worried, and most people were leading lives of unwonted
discomfort.
</p>

<p>
The actual warfare ceased in November, 1918.  After a supreme
effort in the spring of 1918 that almost carried the Germans
to Paris, the Central Powers collapsed.  They had come to an
end of their spirit and resources.

<a name="chapLXVI"></a><h3 align="center">LXVI</h3>

<h4 align="center">THE REVOLUTION AND FAMINE IN RUSSIA</h4>

<p>

BUT a good year and more before the collapse of the Central Powers
 the half oriental monarchy of Russia, which had professed to be the
 continuation of the Byzantine Empire, had collapsed.  The Tsardom
 had been showing signs of profound rottenness for some years before
 the war; the court was under the sway of a fantastic religious
 impostor, Rasputin, and the public administration, civil and
 military, was in a state of extreme inefficiency and corruption.
  At the outset of the war there was a great flare of patriotic
 enthusiasm in Russia.  A vast conscript army was called up, for
 which there was neither adequate military equipment nor a proper
 supply of competent officers, and this great host, ill supplied and
 badly handled, was hurled against the German and Austrian
 frontiers.
</p>

<p>
There can be no doubt that the early appearance of Russian armies in
 East Prussia in September, 1914, diverted the energies and
 attention of the Germans from their first victorious drive upon
 Paris.  The sufferings and deaths of scores of thousands of
 ill-led Russian peasants saved France from complete overthrow in
 that momentous opening campaign, and made all western Europe the
 debtors of that great and tragic people.  But the strain of the war
 upon this sprawling, ill-organized empire was too heavy for its
 strength.  The Russian common soldiers were sent into battle
 without guns to support them, without even rifle ammunition; they
 were wasted by their officers and generals in a delirium of
 militarist enthusiasm.  For a time they seemed to be suffering
 mutely as the beasts suffer; but there is a limit to the endurance
 even of the most ignorant.  A profound disgust for Tsardom was
 creeping through these armies of betrayed and wasted men.  From the
 close of 1915 onward Russia was a source of deepening anxiety to
 her Western Allies.  Throughout 1916 she remained largely on <span
 class="pagenum">{<a name="P416"></a>416}</span>the defensive, and
 there were rumours of a separate peace with Germany.
</p>

<p>
On December 29th, 1916, the monk Rasputin was murdered at a dinner
 party in Petrograd, and a belated attempt was made to put the
 Tsardom in order.  By March things were moving rapidly; food riots
 in Petrograd developed into a revolutionary insurrection; there was
 an attempted suppression of the Duma, the representative body,
 there were attempted arrests of liberal leaders, the formation of a
 provisional government under Prince Lvoff, and an abdication (March
 15th) by the Tsar.  For a time it seemed that a moderate and
 controlled revolution might be possible&#8212;perhaps under a new
 Tsar.  Then it became evident that the destruction of popular
 confidence in Russia had gone too far for any such adjustments.
  The Russian people were sick to death of the old order of things
 in Europe, of Tsars and wars and of Great Powers; it wanted relief,
 and that speedily, from unendurable miseries.  The Allies had no
 understanding of Russian realities; their diplomatists were
 ignorant of Russian, genteel persons with their attention directed
 to the Russian Court rather than to Russia, they blundered steadily
 with the new situation.  There was little goodwill among these
 diplomatists for republicanism, and a manifest disposition to
 embarrass the new government as much as possible.  At the head of
 the Russian republican government was an eloquent and picturesque
 leader, Kerensky, who found himself assailed by the forces of a
 profounder revolutionary movement, the &ldquo;social
 revolution,&rdquo; at home and cold-shouldered by the Allied
 governments abroad.  His Allies would neither let him give the
 Russian peasants the land for which they craved nor peace beyond
 their frontiers.  The French and the British press pestered their
 exhausted ally for a fresh offensive, but when presently the
 Germans made a strong attack by sea and land upon Riga, the
 British Admiralty quailed before the prospect of a Baltic
 expedition in relief.  The new Russian Republic had to fight
 unsupported.  In spite of their naval predominance and the bitter
 protests of the great English admiral, Lord Fisher (1841-1920), it
 is to be noted that the British and their Allies, except for some
 submarine attacks, left the Germans the complete mastery of the
 Baltic throughout the war.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a name="P417"></a>417}</span>The Russian
 masses, however, were resolute to end the war.  At any cost.  There
 had come into existence in Petrograd a body representing the
 workers and common soldiers, the Soviet, and this body clamoured
 for an international conference of socialists at Stockholm.  Food
 riots were occurring in Berlin at this time, war weariness in
 Austria and Germany was profound, and there can be little doubt, in
 the light of subsequent events, that such a conference would have
 precipitated a reasonable peace on democratic lines in 1917 and a
 German revolution.  Kerensky implored his Western allies to allow
 this conference to take place, but, fearful of a worldwide outbreak
 of socialism and republicanism, they refused, in spite of the
 favourable response of a small majority of the British Labour
 Party.  Without either moral or physical help from the Allies, the
 unhappy &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; Russian Republic still fought on and
 made a last desperate offensive effort in July.  It failed after
 some preliminary successes, and there came another great
 slaughtering of Russians.
</p>

<p>
The limit of Russian endurance was reached.  Mutinies broke out in
 the Russian armies, and particularly upon the northern front, and
 on November 7th, 1917, Kerensky&rsquo;s government was overthrown
 and power was seized by the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik
 socialists under Lenin, and pledged to make peace regardless of the
 Western powers.  On March 2nd, 1918, a separate peace between
 Russia and Germany was signed at Brest-Litovsk.

<p>
It speedily became evident that these Bolshevik socialists were men
 of a very different quality from the rhetorical constitutionalists
 and revolutionaries of the Kerensky phase.  They were fanatical
 Marxist communists.  They believed that their accession to power in
 Russia was only the opening of a world-wide social revolution, and
 they set about changing the social and economic order with the
 thoroughness of perfect faith and absolute inexperience.  The
 western European and the American governments were themselves much
 too ill-informed and incapable to guide or help this extraordinary
 experiment, and the press set itself to discredit and the ruling
 classes to wreck these usurpers upon any terms and at any cost to
 themselves or to Russia.  A propaganda of abominable and disgusting
 inventions went on unchecked in the press of the
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P419"></a>419}</span>world; the
 Bolshevik leaders were represented as incredible monsters glutted
 with blood and plunder and living lives of sensuality before which
 the realities of the Tsarist court during the Rasputin regime paled
 to a white purity.  Expeditions were launched at the exhausted
 country, insurgents and raiders were encouraged, armed and
 subsidized, and no method of attack was too mean or too monstrous
 for the frightened enemies of the Bolshevik regime.  In 1919, the
 Russian Bolsheviks, ruling a country already exhausted and
 disorganized by five years of intensive warfare, were fighting a
 British Expedition at Archangel, Japanese invaders in Eastern
 Siberia, Roumanians with French and Greek contingents in the south,
 the Russian Admiral Koltchak in Siberia and General Deniken,
 supported by the French fleet, in the Crimea.  In July of that year
 an Esthonian army, under General Yudenitch, almost got to
 Petersburg.  In 1920 the Poles, incited by the French, made a new
 attack on Russia; and a new reactionary raider, General Wrangel,
 took over the task of General Deniken in invading and devastating
 his own country.  In March, 1921, the sailors at Cronstadt
 revolted.  The Russian Government under its president, Lenin,
 survived all these various attacks.  It showed an amazing tenacity,
 and the common people of Russia sustained it unswervingly under
 conditions of extreme hardship.  By the end of 1921 both Britain
 and Italy had made a sort of recognition of the communist rule.
</p>

<p>
But if the Bolshevik Government was successful in its struggle
 against foreign intervention and internal revolt, it was far less
 happy in its attempts to set up a new social order based upon
 communist ideas in Russia.  The Russian peasant is a small
 land-hungry proprietor, as far from communism in his thoughts and
 methods as a whale is from flying; the revolution gave him the land
 of the great landowners but could not make him grow food for
 anything but negotiable money, and the revolution, among other
 things, had practically destroyed the value of money.
  Agricultural production, already greatly disordered by the
 collapse of the railways through war-strain, shrank to a mere
 cultivation of food by the peasants for their own consumption.  The
 towns starved.  Hasty and ill-planned attempts to make over
 industrial production
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P420"></a>420}</span>in accordance
 with communist ideas were equally unsuccessful.  By 1920 Russia
 presented the unprecedented spectacle of a modern civilization
 in complete collapse.  Railways were rusting and passing out of
 use, towns were falling into ruin, everywhere there was an
 immense mortality.  Yet the country still fought with its
 enemies at its gates.  In 1921 came a drought and a great famine
 among the peasant cultivators in the war-devastated south-east
 provinces.  Millions of people starved.
</p>

<p>
But the question of the distresses and the possible recuperation
 of Russia brings us too close to current controversies to be
 discussed here.

<h4 align="center">THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION OF THE
 WORLD</h4>

<p>

THE scheme and scale upon which this History is planned do not
 permit us to enter into the complicated and acrimonious disputes
 that centre about the treaties, and particularly of the treaty of
 Versailles, which concluded the Great War.  We are beginning to
 realize that that conflict, terrible and enormous as it was, ended
 nothing, began nothing and settled nothing.  It killed millions of
 people; it wasted and impoverished the world.  It smashed Russia
 altogether.  It was at best an acute and frightful reminder that we
 were living foolishly and confusedly without much plan or foresight
 in a dangerous and unsympathetic universe.  The crudely organized
 egotisms and passions of national and imperial greed that carried
 mankind into that tragedy, emerged from it sufficiently unimpaired
 to make some other similar disaster highly probable so soon as the
 world has a little recovered from its war exhaustion and fatigue.
  Wars and revolutions make nothing; their utmost service to mankind
 is that, in a very rough and painful way, they destroy
 superannuated and obstructive things.  The great war lifted the
 threat of German imperialism from Europe, and shattered the
 imperialism of Russia.  It cleared away a number of monarchies.
  But a multitude of flags still waves in Europe, the frontiers
 still exasperate, great armies accumulate fresh stores of
 equipment.
</p>

<p>
The Peace Conference at Versailles was a gathering very ill adapted
 to do more than carry out the conflicts and defeats of the war to
 their logical conclusions.  The Germans, Austrians, Turks and
 Bulgarians were permitted no share in its deliberations; they were
 only to accept the decisions it dictated to them.  From the point
 of view of human welfare the choice of the place of meeting was
 particularly unfortunate.  It was at Versailles in 1871 that, with
 every circumstance of triumphant vulgarity, the new German
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P422"></a>422}</span>Empire had
 been proclaimed.  The suggestion of a melodramatic reversal of that
 scene, in the same Hall of Mirrors, was overpowering.
</p>

<p>
Whatever generosities had appeared in the opening phases of the
 Great War had long been exhausted.  The populations of the
 victorious countries were acutely aware of their own losses and
 sufferings, and entirely regardless of the fact that the defeated
 had paid in the like manner.  The war had arisen as a natural and
 inevitable consequence of the competitive nationalisms of Europe
 and the absence of any Federal adjustment of these competitive
 forces; war is the necessary logical consummation of independent
 sovereign nationalities living in too small an area with too
 powerful an armament; and if the great war had not come in the form
 it did it would have come in some similar form&#8212;just as it
 will certainly return upon a still more disastrous scale in twenty
 or thirty years&rsquo; time if no political unification anticipates
 and prevents it.  States organized for war will make wars as surely
 as hens will lay eggs, but the feeling of these distressed and
 war-worn countries disregarded this fact, and the whole of the
 defeated peoples were treated as morally and materially responsible
 for all the damage, as they would no doubt have treated the victor
 peoples had the issue of war been different.  The French and
 English thought the Germans were to blame, the Germans thought the
 Russians, French and English were to blame, and only an intelligent
 minority thought that there was anything to blame in the
 fragmentary political constitution of Europe.  The treaty of
 Versailles was intended to be exemplary and vindictive; it provided
 tremendous penalties for the vanquished; it sought to provide
 compensations for the wounded and suffering victors by imposing
 enormous debts upon nations already bankrupt, and its attempts to
 reconstitute international relations by the establishment of a
 League of Nations against war were manifestly insincere and
 inadequate.

<p>
So far as Europe was concerned it is doubtful if there would have
 been any attempt whatever to organize international relations for
 a permanent peace.  The proposal of the League of Nations was
 brought into practical politics by the President of the United
 States of America, President Wilson.  Its chief support was in
 America.  So far the United States, this new modern state, had
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P423"></a>423}</span>developed no
 distinctive ideas of international relationship beyond the Monroe
 Doctrine, which protected the new world from European interference.
  Now suddenly it was called upon for its mental contribution to the
 vast problem of the time.  It had none.  The natural disposition of
 the American people was towards a permanent world peace.  With this
 however was linked a strong traditional distrust of old-world
 polities and a habit of isolation from old-world entanglements.
  The Americans had hardly begun to think out an American solution
 of world problems when the submarine campaign of the Germans
 dragged them into the war on the side of the anti-German allies.
  President Wilson&rsquo;s scheme of a League of Nations was an
 attempt at short notice to create a distinctively American world
 project.  It was a sketchy, inadequate and dangerous scheme.  In
 Europe however it was taken as a matured American point of view.
  The generality of mankind in 1918-19 was intensely weary of war
 and anxious at almost any sacrifice to erect
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P424"></a>424}</span>barriers
 against its recurrence, but there was not a single government in
 the old world willing to waive one iota of its sovereign
 independence to attain any such end.  The public utterances of
 President Wilson leading up to the project of a World League of
 Nations seemed for a time to appeal right over the heads of the
 governments to the peoples of the world; they were taken as
 expressing the ripe intentions of America, and the response was
 enormous.  Unhappily President Wilson had to deal with governments
 and not with peoples; he was a man capable of tremendous flashes of
 vision and yet when put to the test egotistical and limited, and
 the great wave of enthusiasm he evoked passed and was wasted.
</p>

<p>
Says Dr. Dillon in his book, <i>The Peace Conference:</i>
 &ldquo;Europe, when the President touched its shores, was as clay
 ready for the creative potter.  Never before were the nations so
 eager to follow a Moses who would take them to the long-promised
 land where wars are prohibited and blockades unknown.  And to their
 thinking he was just that great leader.  In France men bowed down
 before him with awe and affection.  Labour leaders in Paris told
 me that they shed tears of joy in his presence, and that their
 comrades would go through fire and water to help him to realize his
 noble schemes.  To the working classes in Italy his name was a
 heavenly clarion at the sound of which the earth would be renewed.
  The Germans regarded him and his doctrine as their sheet-anchor of
 safety.  The fearless Herr Muehlon said: &lsquo;If President Wilson
 were to address the Germans and pronounce a severe sentence upon
 them, they would accept it with resignation and without a murmur
 and set to work at once.&rsquo;  In German-Austria his fame was
 that of a saviour, and the mere mention of his name brought balm to
 the suffering and surcease of sorrow to the afflicted ... .&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Such were the overpowering expectations that President Wilson
 raised.  How completely he disappointed them and how weak and
 futile was the League of Nations he made is too long and too
 distreesful a story to tell here.  He exaggerated in his person
 our common human tragedy, he was so very great in his dreams and so
 incapable in his performance.  America dissented from the acts of
 its President and would not join the League Europe accepted from
 him.  There was a slow realization on the part of the American
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P425"></a>425}</span>people that it
 had been rushed into something for which it was totally unprepared.
  There was a corresponding realization on the part of Europe that
 America had nothing ready to give to the old world in its
 extremity.  Born prematurely and crippled at its birth, that League
 has become indeed, with its elaborate and unpractical constitution
 and its manifest limitations of power, a serious obstacle in the
 way of any effective reorganization of international relationships.
  The problem would be a clearer one if the League did not yet
 exist.  Yet that world-wide blaze of enthusiasm that first
 welcomed the project, that readiness of men everywhere round and
 about the earth, of men, that is, as distinguished from
 governments, for a world control of war, is a thing to be recorded
 with emphasis in any history.  Behind the short-sighted governments
 that divide and mismanage human affairs, a real force for world
 unity and world order exists and grows.
</p>

<p>
From 1918 onward the world entered upon an age of conferences.  Of
 these the Conference at Washington called by President Harding
 (1921) has been the most successful and suggestive.  Notable, too,
 is the Genoa Conference (1922) for the appearance of German and
 Russian delegates at its deliberations.  We will not discuss this
 long procession of conferences and tentatives in any detail.  It
 becomes more and more clearly manifest that a huge work of
 reconstruction has to be done by mankind if a crescendo of such
 convulsions and world massacres as that of the great war is to be
 averted.  No such hasty improvisation as the League of Nations, no
 patched-up system of Conferences between this group of states and
 that, which change nothing with an air of settling everything, will
 meet the complex political needs of the new age that lies before
 us.  A systematic development and a systematic application of the
 sciences of human relationship, of personal and group psychology,
 of financial and economic science and of education, sciences still
 only in their infancy, is required.  Narrow and obsolete, dead and
 dying moral and political ideas have to be replaced by a clearer
 and a simpler conception of the common origins and destinies of our
 kind.

<p>
But if the dangers, confusions and disasters that crowd upon man in
 these days are enormous beyond any experience of the past, it is
 because science has brought him such powers as he never had
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P426"></a>426}</span>before.
  And the scientific method of fearless thought, exhaustively lucid
 statement, and exhaustively criticized planning, which has given
 him these as yet uncontrollable powers, gives him also the hope of
 controlling these powers.  Man is still only adolescent.  His
 troubles are not the troubles of senility and exhaustion but of
 increasing and still undisciplined strength.  When we look at all
 <span class="pagenum">{<a name="P427"></a>427}</span>history as one
 process, as we have been doing in this book, when we see the
 steadfast upward struggle of life towards vision and control, then
 we see in their true proportions the hopes and dangers of the
 present time.  As yet we are hardly in the earliest dawn of human
 greatness.  But in the beauty of flower and sunset, in the happy
 and perfect movement of young animals and in the delight of ten
 thousand various landscapes, we have some intimations of what life
 can do for us, and in some few works of plastic and pictorial art,
 in some great music, in a few noble buildings and happy gardens, we
 have an intimation of what the human will can do with material
 possibilities.  We have dreams; we have at present undisciplined
 but ever increasing power.  Can we doubt that presently our race
 will more than realize our boldest imaginations, that it will
 achieve unity and peace, that it will live, the children of our
 blood and lives will live, in a world made more splendid and lovely
 than any palace or garden that we know, going on from strength to
 strength in an ever widening circle of adventure and achievement?
  What man has done, the little triumphs of his present state, and
 all this history we have told, form but the prelude to the things
 that man has got to do.

<p>
About the year 1000 <small>B.C.</small> the Aryan peoples were
 establishing
themselves in the peninsulas of Spain, Italy and the Balkans, and
they were established in North India; Cnossos was already
destroyed and the spacious times of Egypt, of Thothmes III,
Amenophis III and Rameses II were three or four centuries away.
Weak monarchs of the XXIst Dynasty were ruling in the Nile Valley.
Israel was united under her early kings; Saul or David or possibly
even Solomon may have been reigning.  Sargon I (2750
 <small>B.C.</small>) of the
Akkadian Sumerian Empire was a remote memory in Babylonian
history, more remote than is Constantine the Great from the world
of the present day.  Hammurabi had been dead a thousand years.
The Assyrians were already dominating the less military
Babylonians.  In 1100 <small>B.C.</small> Tiglath Pileser I had
 taken Babylon.
But there was no permanent conquest; Assyria and Babylonia were
still separate empires.  In China the new Chow dynasty was
flourishing.  Stonehenge in England was already some hundreds of
years old.
</p>

<p>
The next two centuries saw a renascence of Egypt under the XXIInd
Dynasty, the splitting up of the brief little Hebrew kingdom of
Solomon, the spreading of the Greeks in the Balkans, South Italy
and Asia Minor, and the days of Etruscan predominance in Central
Italy.  We begin our list of ascertainable dates with

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A SHORT HISTORY OF THE WORLD ***

***** This file should be named 35461-h.htm or 35461-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Donald F. Behan

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
